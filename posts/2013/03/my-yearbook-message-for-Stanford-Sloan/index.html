		<div class="well small">Permalink: <a class="more" href="../../../../posts/2013/03/my-yearbook-message-for-Stanford-Sloan/">2013-03-10 17:29:00</a> in <a href="../../../../category/stanford">Stanford</a>

		<div><p>One of the benefits of sitting right next to my Sloan-mate Nicki Carter, who is co-leading an admirable and spirited effort of publishing Yearbook of Sloan Class of 2013,  is that I can rest assured to receive regular reminder about my yearbook message status for no less than ... four times a week. After leading Nicki's "Hall of Shame" for many weeks in a row, I decided to redeem  myself in front of Nicki and get it over with. For someone with a petty education background prior to Stanford, I actually don't think I've ever written a yearbook message before. So I did a bit of research to see what this whole yearbook message thing is about in US, and I've arrived at the following takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing the yearbook message could be quite an effort, especially if</li>
<li>you want to stand out and leave something others can remember you by</li>
<li>the message should be original, creative, witty, and memorable, to say the least; being inspirational or cruel will be a plus</li>
<li>use quotes</li>
</ul>
<p>After spending a few hours to dig out some old emails and blogs, I came up with my yearbook message, finally. </p>
