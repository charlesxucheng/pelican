		<div class="well small">Permalink: <a class="more" href="../../../../posts/2013/01/why-search-funds-make-sense/">2013-01-24 16:07:00</a> in <a href="../../../../category/stanford">Stanford</a>
tags: <a href="../../../../tag//"></a> </div>
		<div><p>Some Stanford lecturers and alumni are involved in the business of
search fund, but this is one type of investment vehicle that is often
not well understood by people from outside. The model makes sense to the
three parties involved in the following ways ... I think:</p>
<p><em>For the searchers</em> (MBAs in pair, who go raising capital to fund the
search, identify an acquisition target company, raise more capital to
buy it, run it for several years, and sell it for profit at the right
EBIDTA),</p>
<ul>
<li>This model is almost exclusively for MBAs (mostly young) with little
    to no operating/management experience but have some entrepreneurial
    spirit to be a change agent and live their lives on their own terms.</li>
<li>It fits with newly minted MBAs' desire of running businesses,
    improving operation and managing processes.</li>
<li>Many MBAs (especially those with consulting or banking background)
    have no particular desire for product creation/development, nor
    strong passion for any particular domains, but want to run a
    business by applying business school tactics and skills. Search
    fund's model suits such desire.</li>
<li>It provides to the searchers the opportunity to become CEO of a
    small to medium-sized company (right away after the search is
    completed and the deal is closed), which is not available to most
    MBA graduates.</li>
<li>The searchers have the luxury of learning the business at reasonable
    pace and groom themselves into effective CEOs because search fund
    targets are usually cash flow positive business with stable business
    models.</li>
<li>The searchers don't have to deal with the nuances faced by the CEO
    of a typical startup, like handling all the back room matters.</li>
<li>There is a possibility that it could be relatively easy to turn
    around a small-sized traditional type of business that doesn't
    typically embrace modern management practice such as regular team
    meetings or neat financial analysis from Excel. There might be many
    low-hanging fruits there.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For the investors</em> (individuals who give capital to the searchers)</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower risk (lower return as well) because the target companies
    already have EBIDTA and a stable operating structure and
    environment.</li>
<li>Lower entry of investment compared to VC and PE funds.</li>
<li>Contrarian play because most of the target companies are in
    traditional, less sexy industries (but with potential to unlock
    value from simple process improvement) that are often overlooked by
    the VC/PE firms.</li>
<li>Lower risk from more flexibility in capital commitment due to the
    two-staged funding process and the usual right-of-the-first-refusal
    clause.</li>
<li>Ability to get much more involvement and utilize his/her own domain
    expertise, unlike being a LP in a typical VC/PE fund.</li>
<li>Better access to the invested target companies because GP =
    Management team, which provides a higher level of comfort and lowers
    the perceived risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For the sellers</em> (current owners of the target company who sell the
company to the search fund)</p>
<ul>
<li>Search funds might be the only buyers available as their companies
    are usually fairly small, under the radar screen of the big VC/PE
    firms.</li>
<li>Suits the needs for the owners/founders who want to retire but want
    to make sure the business is in good hands as search fund GPs are
    much more committed than typical VC professionals, who are pure
    financial investors.</li>
