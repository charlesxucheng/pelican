  <div>
    <p>On Dec 12, 2012, our rock band of Sloan Class of 2013, <em>The
Spillovers</em>, debuted with a four-song set list at the end-of-quarter
Dinner &amp; Dance party for the Sloan class. After 14 days of intense
rehearsals during the nerve-breaking final-exam weeks, we had a blast
and shredded the night away.</p>
<p>One of our drummers John is a local here. Right at the beginning of our
academic year, he proposed on our Facebook Group page that we should
form a rock band. Not surprisingly, no much response was received at
that time as Sloans were all busy figuring out where to get lockers and
mattress, that sort of thing, pretty low on the whole
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. It took one flash mob (of Gangnam Style)
and one NCAA half-time performance (Gangnam Style, again) for the Sloan
Class of 2013 to proudly announce its arrival in the Hall of Fame
and demonstrate to Graduate School of Business and Stanford University
that there is no mountain that cannot be conquered by this class of
unprecedented enormous talent. So when Tracee, our co-social chair for
the Autumn Quarter, commissioned for a band performance at this
Sloans-Gone-Wild Dinner &amp; Dance party, this monumental task naturally
fell upon the shoulders of a few choice individuals who got bored with
final exams (maybe just academic study in general, especially
Accounting) and have developed a habit of making history for Sloans, for
GSB, and for Stanford.</p>
<p>The band was taking shape quickly. I knew Yuki and Jun both played
guitar and could sing very well, from our crazy karaoke parties in Music
Tunnel in Sunny Vale; I knew Ryan and I were in the same school of rock
through Facebook chat even before we met in Stanford; I knew Colin
always had the aspiration to be a rock singer at the house party of
California Ave; Cherie and I shared the same passion for rock music
festival; I knew Tracee would be game for anything; everybody saw how
good a drummer Alex was on our Deepavali party and I knew Su could play
keyboard by.... whatever.. I just did.</p>
<p>Getting a venue to practice and all the music instruments/amps usually
would be a huge challenge to any new band. Luckily we had John The
Resourceful, who graciously offered his big house nearby the campus for
our jam sessions; and we had Ryan The Passion, who went on a buying
spree for a guitar (Paul Reed Smith no less!) , a bass, and three
amplifiers. I managed to borrow two microphones from a local friend.
Tracee helped us set up the on-site logistics for the party night and we
were all set to go.</p>
<p>Between Nov 29 and Dec 12, we had five jam sessions. It was a ton of
fun, sometimes because John's adorable in-house girls rock band warmed
the stage for us, sometimes because we were all in awe by
Colin's quintessential power rocker pose, or sometimes because Yuki's
impromptu guita riff brought us back to the good old days of Pink Floyd
and Led Zeppelin, before JB of the kind took over the world. John always
served us good pizza, beer and wine. LSD would be the only missing piece
to make this a perfect party to get high.</p>
<p>Most of our band members have played in some sort of rock band before,
like twenty years ago in high school. Some of us did that in secrecy
without the knowledge of our wives - which became a moment of great
revelation during the debut performance that would forever live as one
of the urban legends of this class. When I lived in Beijing between 2008
- 2012, I hanged out with a group of friends who were all <a href="http://site.douban.com/peixi/">phenomenal
singers</a>. Often we jammed at some
bars/clubs with the in-house band when they finished their set for the
night and the crowd has left. We always had a dream of forming a band of
our own, but quickly we realized there would be too many vocals and the
band would be missing players for guitar, bass, drum, trumpet, or
keyboard. Basically, as far as forming a band went, we were all useless.
Who would have thought, I would live my dream in Stanford, in a bona
fide rock band? It felt good.</p>
<p>The band name The Spillovers came from our depleted brains when
preparing for the final exam of Global Strategies - it's one of those
strategy lingoes that no one except Professor John Roberts really
understands what it actually means. Loosely, it's about synergy that
spills over from one to another. We had a lot of fun jamming together at
John's house and positive energy was flowing in the air - so the name
naturally stuck with us.</p>
<p>The night of our debut finally arrived. The Dinner &amp; Dance party was a
black-tie event, which constrained to some extend how outlandish we
could dress the part for the band performance. We didn't go as far as
wearing latex rocker pants (we had that), but we pulled the best effort
we could under the circumstance. Colin and I changed into tight T-shirt
and wore a bandana; John and Alex wore a pirate wig; Yuki played up
Brit-Pop flare; Jun got his party outfit on; Tracee got the Dylan hat
on; Cherie and Su looked gorgeous and sexy. The best-dressed honor went
to none other than Ryan, who put up ultra-heavy make-up and became
utterly unrecognizable in true spirit of KISS' Gene Simmons.</p>
<p>...and the rest, is history.</p>
