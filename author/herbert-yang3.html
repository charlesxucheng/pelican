We squeezed out every inch in Havana Room but still could not find enough chairs/tables for all the Sloans and the partners. The party followed a format that was familiar to every Mainland Chinese - a gala filled with delicious food, baijiu (Chinese white wine, very hard-core liquor), stage performances, and variety shows. Not only it was a banquet of food and drink, but also it was a total cultural immersion of three hours in which I walked through five parts of some interesting elements of Chinese culture.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/03/chinese-new-year-party/">more…</a>

After leading Nicki's "Hall of Shame" for many weeks in a row, I decided to redeem  myself in front of Nicki and get it over with. For someone with a petty education background prior to Stanford, I actually don't think I've ever written a yearbook message before. So I did a bit of research to see what this whole yearbook message thing is about in US, and I've arrived at the following takeaways</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/03/my-yearbook-message-for-Stanford-Sloan/">more…</a>

	<div class="summary"><p>In the first week of the third quarter of my 12-month Sloan academic year, I find myself spending at least 2-3 hours every day this week in a perpetual (often futile ) attempt to optimize my courses for this quarter. The exhaustive and reiterative process has been very tiring, but much needed. Because the course selection of Winter Quarter is critical, unique and sets the course for half of my Sloan year. In Summer and Fall Quarter, our curriculum was largely the same with limited variations - there was not much we can do to adjust the curriculum. Things start getting interesting in Winter Quarter, when we only have two classes together (Finance and Marketing) and need to fill up more than 50% of our academic calendar with self-selected coures from GSB and other school. The below 15 factors, in descending order of importance, might be helpful in strategizing your most optimal course portfolio, from the perspective of a GSB Sloan.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/01/15-things-to-know-in-strategizing-your-course-portfolio/">more…</a>
