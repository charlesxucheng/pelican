	<div class="summary"><p>From a recent project in my favorite course of the quarter: OB388 Leadership in Entertainment Business, my group researched and analyzed the success of K-Pop. During this exhilarating intellectual process, I came up with this graph that illustrates how to find the optimal path of nurturing a star from scratch. The horizontal dimension, from low to high, represents the technical difficulty of acquiring certain skills (which are also the cultural products those stars will eventually produce) for a star in an entertainment business. The vertical dimension, from low to high, represents  the cultural barrier those cultural products will encounter when they are delivered to a foreign culture (like from South Korea to America).</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/06/how-to-make-a-star/">more…</a>

Unsatisfied with what was available, I started developing a more effective framework/methodology to find out the key drivers that may explain why I like doing certain things more than others and figure out what would be my best career choice given what I want.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/05/drivers-of-your-life/">more…</a>

This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a "ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before it in dust.

We squeezed out every inch in Havana Room but still could not find enough chairs/tables for all the Sloans and the partners. The party followed a format that was familiar to every Mainland Chinese - a gala filled with delicious food, baijiu (Chinese white wine, very hard-core liquor), stage performances, and variety shows. Not only it was a banquet of food and drink, but also it was a total cultural immersion of three hours in which I walked through five parts of some interesting elements of Chinese culture.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/03/chinese-new-year-party/">more…</a>
