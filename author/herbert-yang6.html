	<h2>Redesign Business Model of Animation Films</h2>

	<div class="summary"><p>Turn a “hit-driven” model into a “growth-driven” model with “hit” potential. In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation, the maker of highly successful franchises of “Shrek” and “Madagascar”, laid off 350 of its 2,200 employees. The restructuring was driven by disappointing results of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446192/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Rise of the Guardians</a>, which forced the studio to take $87 Million charge. The shocking news begs the question: what’s wrong with DreamWorks Animation Studio, or what’s wrong with animation film business in general? Animation film business has always been a hit-driven model. What happens when the streak ends and a hit becomes a dud? Animation film industry has had a great run in the last 20 years. Pixar’s cultural phenomenon Toy Story (1995) marked the arrival of 3D animation. Since then several specialized animation studios have emerged and become dominant players in this space, such as Pixar, DreamWorks Animation, and Blue Sky (Fox). They have created some of the most recognized global brands from Hollywood, such as Toy Story, Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, and Ice Age. Pixar’s unbelievable streak of 13 hits in a row has become the stuff of legend not only in Hollywood, but also in the entire business world.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../redesign-business-model-of-animation-films"> more </a>

This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a "ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before it in dust.

	<div class="summary"><p>In descending order of importance, Complete your Linkedin profile. Linkedin has been used extensively by business schools, head hunters, and HR recruitment officers of many companies in US. It's gone mainstream and become a must-have in Stanford GSB. If you're looking for a job after Stanford, you can probably afford not to have a Facebook account, but you can't afford to have no Linkedin account. Linkedin helps to validate your professional history and it currently owns this market space. Get your personal linkedin URL and don't use the default system-generated random link, which no one remembers and looks amateurish. Spend quality time to polish and complete the Linkedin profile. A well updated Linkedin profile takes long time to fine-tune.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../10-things-to-do-before-coming-to-stanford-sloan-master-program"> more </a>

We squeezed out every inch in Havana Room but still could not find enough chairs/tables for all the Sloans and the partners. The party followed a format that was familiar to every Mainland Chinese - a gala filled with delicious food, baijiu (Chinese white wine, very hard-core liquor), stage performances, and variety shows. Not only it was a banquet of food and drink, but also it was a total cultural immersion of three hours in which I walked through five parts of some interesting elements of Chinese culture.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../chinese-new-year-party"> more </a>

	<div class="summary"><p>One of the benefits of sitting right next to my Sloan-mate Nicki Carter, who is co-leading an admirable and spirited effort of publishing Yearbook of Sloan Class of 2013,  is that I can rest assured to receive regular reminder about my yearbook message status for no less than ... four times a week. After leading Nicki's "Hall of Shame" for many weeks in a row, I decided to redeem  myself in front of Nicki and get it over with. For someone with a petty education background prior to Stanford, I actually don't think I've ever written a yearbook message before. So I did a bit of research to see what this whole yearbook message thing is about in US, and I've arrived at the following takeaways</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../my-yearbook-message-for-Stanford-Sloan"> more </a>
