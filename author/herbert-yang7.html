                            <p class="post-meta"><p>As I was actively procrastinating on one of the final papers for the quarter, I did what I do most naturally - checking out movies. When I was in China during the past five years, one of the things I missed the most about America was its summer time, when exciting tentpole event movies came out one after another, one-upping each other on box-office records. It's the quintessential  American cultural immersion experience. At times of feeling down in January - April, I would cheer myself up by thinking, it's OK, the summer is coming, there will be many great movies to watch and plenty fantasies to live in.</p></p>

                            <p class="post-meta"><p>In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation, the maker of highly successful franchises of “Shrek” and “Madagascar”, laid off 350 of its 2,200 employees. The restructuring was driven by disappointing results of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446192/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Rise of the Guardians</a>, which forced the studio to take $87 Million charge. The shocking news begs the question: what’s wrong with DreamWorks Animation Studio, or what’s wrong with animation film business in general? Animation film business has always been a hit-driven model. What happens when the streak ends and a hit becomes a dud? Animation film industry has had a great run in the last 20 years. Pixar’s cultural phenomenon Toy Story (1995) marked the arrival of 3D animation. Since then several specialized animation studios have emerged and become dominant players in this space, such as Pixar, DreamWorks Animation, and Blue Sky (Fox). They have created some of the most recognized global brands from Hollywood, such as Toy Story, Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, and Ice Age. Pixar’s unbelievable streak of 13 hits in a row has become the stuff of legend not only in Hollywood, but also in the entire business world.</p></p>

                            <p class="post-meta"><p>By 2007 I had tried out every career assessment tool or personality test there was in the market.   Those tests were helpful to some extent, but the overall value was limited, at least for me. Unsatisfied with what was available, I started developing a more effective framework/methodology to find out the key drivers that may explain why I like doing certain things more than others and figure out what would be my best career choice given what I want.</p></p>

This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a "ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before it in dust. It was finished right at the very last second before class president John Barton finished his introduction of me.</p></p>

                            <p class="post-meta"><p>In descending order of importance, Complete your Linkedin profile. Linkedin has been used extensively by business schools, head hunters, and HR recruitment officers of many companies in US. It's gone mainstream and become a must-have in Stanford GSB. If you're looking for a job after Stanford, you can probably afford not to have a Facebook account, but you can't afford to have no Linkedin account. Linkedin helps to validate your professional history and it currently owns this market space. Get your personal linkedin URL and don't use the default system-generated random link, which no one remembers and looks amateurish. Spend quality time to polish and complete the Linkedin profile. A well updated Linkedin profile takes long time to fine-tune.</p></p>
