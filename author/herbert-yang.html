	<div class="summary"><p>Joseph D. Grant County Park is located toward the end end of the Bay Area in San Jose, about 40-minute drive from Palo Alto. We came here in early spring trying to catch some wild flowers. Didn't see much blossom yet but the scenery on the hill was quite a treat. There were not too many people in the park. Nearby the park there are numerous biking routes. Right off the parking lot there is a small lake.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2014/03/hiking-joseph-d-grant-county-park-east-bay/">more…</a>

	<div class="summary"><p>When I look back at the past year in Stanford/GSB/Sloan Fellow Program and reflect what was it that we tried to get out of this incredible experience, I think our goals fall into six mutually exclusive and collective exhaustive categories, namely, PFIKER. It is important for us to know what our goals are, from Day One into the community, so that we can strategize priorities, plan our academic and social life accordingly, to get the most out of our time in Stanford. 12 months go by really, really fast. Without clear goals in mind, it's easy to let the time and opportunities slip through our fingers before we know it.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/07/goals-in-stanford/">more…</a>

	<div class="summary"><p>By 2007 I had tried out every career assessment tool or personality test there was in the market.   Those tests were helpful to some extent, but the overall value was limited, at least for me. Unsatisfied with what was available, I started developing a more effective framework/methodology to find out the key drivers that may explain why I like doing certain things more than others and figure out what would be my best career choice given what I want.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/05/drivers-of-your-life/">more…</a>

This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a "ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before it in dust. It was finished right at the very last second before class president John Barton finished his introduction of me.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/04/a-day-in-a-sloans-life/">more…</a>

This diagram is built on a framework I developed a while ago, which was written in Chinese and I haven't got the chance to translate into English (if you know of any free secretary service, please let me know. I can certainly use one or two.)</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/03/an-entrepreneurs-manifesto-POOOUA-model/">more…</a>
