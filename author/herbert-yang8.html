            <p class="post-meta"><p>One of the benefits of sitting right next to my Sloan-mate Nicki Carter, who is co-leading an admirable and spirited effort of publishing Yearbook of Sloan Class of 2013,  is that I can rest assured to receive regular reminder about my yearbook message status for no less than ... four times a week. After leading Nicki's "Hall of Shame" for many weeks in a row, I decided to redeem  myself in front of Nicki and get it over with. For someone with a petty education background prior to Stanford, I actually don't think I've ever written a yearbook message before. So I did a bit of research to see what this whole yearbook message thing is about in US, and I've arrived at the following takeaways</p></p>

            <p class="post-meta"><p>Before we know, 8 months have flown by and now we're 4 months away from graduation. All good things will come to an end, and our wonderful journey at Sloan Fellow Program in Stanford GSB is of no exception. The question is: how can we make the most out of this 12-month period? I think the Fall Quarter from October to December is the "sweet spot" that we should take the most advantage of.</p></p>

The audience for this party consists of 80 Sloan Fellows with their partners/children that come from 30+ countries all over the world with age ranging from 30 - 45（roughly）.</p></p>

        <h3><a class="post-title" href="../15-things-to-know-in-strategizing-your-course-portfolio">COASSF#42 - 15 Things to Know in Strategizing Your Sloan Courses</a></h3>
            <p class="post-meta"><p>In the first week of the third quarter of my 12-month Sloan academic year, I find myself spending at least 2-3 hours every day this week in a perpetual (often futile ) attempt to optimize my courses for this quarter. The exhaustive and reiterative process has been very tiring, but much needed. Because the course selection of Winter Quarter is critical, unique and sets the course for half of my Sloan year. In Summer and Fall Quarter, our curriculum was largely the same with limited variations - there was not much we can do to adjust the curriculum. Things start getting interesting in Winter Quarter, when we only have two classes together (Finance and Marketing) and need to fill up more than 50% of our academic calendar with self-selected coures from GSB and other school. The below 15 factors, in descending order of importance, might be helpful in strategizing your most optimal course portfolio, from the perspective of a GSB Sloan.</p></p>

            <p class="post-meta"><p>Some Stanford lecturers and alumni are involved in the business of search fund, but this is one type of investment vehicle that is often not well understood by people from outside. The model makes sense to the three parties involved in the following ways ... I think: For the searchers** (MBAs in pair, who go raising capital to fund the search, identify an acquisition target company, raise more capital to buy it, run it for several years, and sell it for profit at the right EBIDTA)</p></p>
