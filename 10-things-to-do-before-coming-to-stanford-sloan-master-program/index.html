		<div><p>In descending order of importance,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Complete your <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/herbertyang">Linkedin
    profile</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Linkedin has been used extensively by business schools, head
    hunters, and HR recruitment officers of many companies in US.
    It's gone mainstream and become a must-have in Stanford GSB. If
    you're looking for a job after Stanford, you can probably afford
    not to have a Facebook account, but you can't afford to have no
    Linkedin account. Linkedin helps to validate your professional
    history and it currently owns this market space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get your personal linkedin URL and don't use the default
    system-generated random link, which no one remembers and
    looks amateurish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend quality time to polish and complete the Linkedin profile.
    A well updated Linkedin profile takes long time to fine-tune.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategize on your personal branding</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Think long and hard about how you want others to label/perceive
    you in KISS (Keep It Simple and Stupid) terms, for example, that startup guy, the VC dude,
    the hard-core quant guy, the non-profit lady, the corporate
    dude, the inventor genius, that marketing girl, etc. Ideally you
    want this reputation to precede yourself because that's how
    people start paying attention to you and pointing resources to
    you, in a crowded market filled with over-achievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>12 months fly by fast. The race of getting attention starts
    right on the first day when you land on campus. The earlier you
    can establish your personal brand/reputation, the more milage
    you can get out of your limited days in Stanford's universe. In
    fact, once you start promoting yourself with a solid brand that
    conveys what you bring and what you're looking for, many new
    friends and resources will start aligning around you naturally
    without you even trying. Yeah, it's magical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you've identified the personal brand for yourself, don't
    change it. It's pretty costly to change a product positioning.
    The same goes for a personal brand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know what you want to get out of Stanford/Sloan</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We come to Stanford Sloan for <a href="../../../2012/08/live-stanford-life-to-the-fullest/">many different
    reasons</a>.
    Some are looking for career transition; some are looking for
    knowledge; some are looking for business partners; some are
    looking for validation; some are looking for professor's
    attention; some are looking for friends; some are looking for
    dates; some are looking for babies, some are just looking for
    chill. Our goal determines our plan; our plan determines how we
    will use our most precious asset - time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For me, I'm looking for inspirations and partners. Coming from a
    pretty extensive business and finance background, I try to
    unlearn frameworks and theories that I deem no longer relevant
    or useful to me. I try to keep as little things in my mind as
    possible so that my mind can stay in its most vigilant and
    free-roaming state. Besides that, I spend a lot of time hanging
    out with  my classmates in various activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare for the accounting exemption exam</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to opt out of Accounting (a core course) in Summer
    Quarter, you need to take the Accounting exemption exam a few
    days before the start of Summer Quarter.  For my year it was an
    open-book, closed-door, fixed-time exam. Many students with
    finance background took it, got exempted, and enrolled into
    critically-acclaimed Professor Charles Lee's Alphanomics - a
    highly sought-after class for those quant-minded hard-core
    finance students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For those who get exempted from Accounting, they have to take
    another finance-themed class of more advanced level. I've gone
    soft over the years and not hard-core at all now, and I didn't
    intend to build myself into an investment guru in Stanford GSB.
    So I didn't take the Accounting exemption exam. It was much
    easier to get by in basic Accounting than Alphanomics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy the latest Macbook Air</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apple's Macbook Air (not Macbook Pro) is hands down the best
    overall notebook for business school students. It's light, fast,
    powerful, and sleek. If your're about to change for a new
    notebook, use your Stanford email/ID to enjoy the student
    discount and get the latest model of Macbook Air. There might be
    lighter notebooks out there like Sony/Samsung, but they're using
    Windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(This is getting off the track a bit) All your personal files,
    including digital media ones (mainly photos), should be stored
    in some combination of Dropbox, Skydrive, Box, and Google Drive, the four most prominent cloud storage services. No additional
    back-up is needed. (However, as of April 2014, I'm moving away from all the above cloud services and switching to BitTorrent Sync)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research on what car you want to buy</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you decide you'll eventually need a car in the Bay Area, make
    the purchase decision as early as possible. The further away
    you're deferring this decision, the more money you'll be losing
    on the car you buy. Buying a car early in the Summer brings you
    a world of benefits and goodwill. Do not procrastinate. Make
    this the No.2 priority after arriving in SFO. (No.1 priority is
    to get a local phone number with 650 zip code)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Car-purchase decision in US can be done entirely on the
    Internet, where you can find anything you need for this very
    mature market. You can ping down which car dealer has the exact
    car you want and close the transaction in one day. For me I got
    my local phone number on Day 2 and bought the car on Day 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a related note, get a California driver's license and a State
    ID as early as you can. Do not count on using your
    home-country's driver's license for the entire Sloan year, which
    is doable but not advisable, at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare for BBLs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="../../../2012/12/my-bbl/">BBL</a>
    is one of the most amazing experiences out of Sloan Program and
    it should not be taken lightly. They form a very strong and
    intimate bonding among Sloans. Based on our
    preferences/requests, staff will schedule the BBL sessions for
    all the Sloans throughout the entire academic year (usually 4
    BBLs during one lunch session).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here's the golden rule: <em>the earlier you can finish your BBL,
    the better</em>. Just like in any other typical new social
    environment, people's interest in getting to know others is at
    peak level when the party just starts,  then it gradually slows
    down and diminishes as the party is coming to the end, since
    most people already form their own social circles and know who
    they want to hang out with. You do not want to be sitting at the
    end of that
    <a href="../../../2013/03/sloan-fellow-life-cycle-how-to-make-the-most-out-of-it/">curve</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring your national costumes, for BBLs, and also for culture
    night parties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify your dinner targets</p>
<p>Following the same <a href="../../../2013/03/sloan-fellow-life-cycle-how-to-make-the-most-out-of-it/">life-cycle analysis for the 12-month
    period</a>, Summer and Fall Quarters are the best time to make some new
    friends before MBAs take over the airwave and we're swamped by
    rigorous academic workload in Winter Quarter. No matter how busy
    you think you are in Summer Quarter, it'll be nothing compared
    to Winter Quarter. Check out the profiles of your fellow
    students before
    arriving on campus and start scheduling 1-1/2-2 lunch/dinner
    with them. In Winter Quarter private dinner time with another
    Sloan will be a luxury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know what class officer role you want to play</p>
<p>Throughout the 12-month period, probably more than half of my class will have performed some class officer roles. While every
    class officer role entails something very different, it's
    advisable to step up and do something for your class, especially
    when you have a generally forgiving crowd to work with. As my
    <a href="../../../2012/08/chair-analysis/">previous
    analysis demonstrates</a>, social chair has the highest reward/effort ratio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design your own namecards</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is a highly idiosyncratic move but I think it's worth
    trying. We don't have to use the standard business card from the
    program that has the Stanford logo. We can just design our <a href="../../../2012/12/a-new-business-card/">own
    name cards with a
    style</a>. It will
    stand out easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then how do we print the Stanford logo on our own namecards? I
    would not even bother. If the recipient of my namecard doesn't
    even believe I'm from Stanford as I claim, then he/she probably
    does not deserve to receive my namecard in the first place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

Days</a>,
