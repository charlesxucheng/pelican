	<div class="summary"><p>One of the benefits of sitting right next to my Sloan-mate Nicki Carter, who is co-leading an admirable and spirited effort of publishing Yearbook of Sloan Class of 2013,  is that I can rest assured to receive regular reminder about my yearbook message status for no less than ... four times a week. After leading Nicki's "Hall of Shame" for many weeks in a row, I decided to redeem  myself in front of Nicki and get it over with. For someone with a petty education background prior to Stanford, I actually don't think I've ever written a yearbook message before. So I did a bit of research to see what this whole yearbook message thing is about in US, and I've arrived at the following takeaways</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="./posts/2013/03/my-yearbook-message-for-Stanford-Sloan/">more…</a>

All good things will come to an end, and our wonderful journey at Sloan Fellow Program in Stanford GSB is of no exception. The question is: how can we make the most out of this 12-month period? I think the Fall Quarter from October to December is the "sweet spot" that we should take the most advantage of.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="./posts/2013/03/sloan-fellow-life-cycle-how-to-make-the-most-out-of-it/">more…</a>

The staff at Palo Alto Fedex office on California Ave was extremely helpful and gave me all the necessary instructions. So I came up with this design using good old PowerPoint. It worked well. The proof sample looked pretty sleek. I shall receive the actual cards by Monday.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="./posts/2012/12/a-new-business-card/">more…</a>

	<div class="summary"><p>I've been thinking about evaluating each course I've taken in Stanford Sloan Program individually, but I'm afraid that my often highly opinionated remarks would hurt some feelings and doom my future career in the Silicon Valley. So I developed a framework during today's less-than-eventful class, called CIDRAE to express a more balanced and comprehensive critique for each course. My idea was inspired from the group exercise project (the U Penn PhD curriculum one) for a course in the Fall Quarter.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="./posts/2012/10/evaluate-course-with-CIDRAE/">more…</a>
