    <p>One of the benefits of sitting right next to my Sloan-mate Nicki Carter, who is co-leading an admirable and spirited effort of publishing Yearbook of Sloan Class of 2013,  is that I can rest assured to receive regular reminder about my yearbook message status for no less than ... four times a week. After leading Nicki's "Hall of Shame" for many weeks in a row, I decided to redeem  myself in front of Nicki and get it over with. For someone with a petty education background prior to Stanford, I actually don't think I've ever written a yearbook message before. So I did a bit of research to see what this whole yearbook message thing is about in US, and I've arrived at the following takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing the yearbook message could be quite an effort, especially if</li>
<li>you want to stand out and leave something others can remember you by</li>
<li>the message should be original, creative, witty, and memorable, to say the least; being inspirational or cruel will be a plus</li>
<li>use quotes</li>
</ul>
<p>After spending a few hours to dig out some old emails and blogs, I came up with my yearbook message, finally. </p>
<p>"At first, I was afraid, I was petrified. Kept thinking, I could never do this well with all of you shining by my side. But then I spent so many minutes thinking, how I came here. And I grew strong and I learned how to introduce myself." - <em>first meeting</em>, July 1, 2012</p>
<p>"Social is the path to the bright side. Social leads to fun. Fun leads to happiness. Happiness leads to friends" - <em>Social Chair Report on Class Meeting</em>, July 25, 2012</p>

<p>"At times of uncertainties or Act of God, do not panic, do not question, do not hesitate, just follow my command" - <em>Gangnam Style flash mob</em>, Oct 12, 2012</p>
<p>"This would triumph all other accomplishments we could possibly amass in the Sloan program" - <em>Stanford NCAA Men's Basketball Game half-time show</em>, Nov 12, 2012</p>
<p>"Our distinguished project team consists of trendy investment bankers, experienced corporate executives, swashbuckling management consultants, illuminary government dignitaries, and Simon" - <em>Generative Leadership group presentation by Lost Child</em>, Nov 30, 2012</p>
<p>"And so Sally can't wait, she knows we're too brave as we're dancing on by. Her mind blown away, and don't look back in sadness. We're here to stay. " - <em>The Spillovers Debut</em>, Dec 12, 2012</p>
<p>"Whatever happens in Seatle, stays in Seatle" - <em>Seatle study trip</em>, Dec 15, 2012</p>
<p>"Estonia and Sweden, Join hands, join hands together, We're friends forever' - <em>Lake Tahoe Ski Trip #1</em>, Jan 19, 2013</p>
<p>"Story leads to discovery; discovery leads to enlightenment; enlightenment leads to happiness" - <em>Chinese New Year Party</em>, Feb 08, 2013</p>
<p>"Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide. No escape from reality. Open your eyes. Look up to the skies and see." - <em>Lake Tahoe Ski Trip #2</em>, Feb 16, 2013</p>
<p>“Though you might be hiding away from the madding crowd in Hotel California listening to the Wind of Change, The Spillovers will Twist and Shout, and play With or Without You. After all, It's My Life and I Hate Myself For Loving You. As long as you Smell Like a Teen Spirit, I Wish You Were Here and I Don't Want To Miss A Thing by letting go the last chance of amusing you before you go on the epic East Coast Trip. Don't Cry... this is not Touchy Feely. This is from The Spillovers. Out.”  <em>The Spillovers Curtain Call</em>, Mar 21, 2013</p>
