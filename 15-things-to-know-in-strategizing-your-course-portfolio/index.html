            <p>In the first week of the third quarter of my 12-month Sloan academic
year, I find myself spending at least 2-3 hours every day this week in a
perpetual (often futile ) attempt to optimize my courses for this
quarter. The exhaustive and reiterative process has been very tiring,
but much needed. Because the course selection of Winter Quarter is
critical, unique and sets the course for half of my Sloan year. In
Summer and Fall Quarter, our curriculum was largely the same with
limited variations - there was not much we can do to adjust the
curriculum. Things start getting interesting in Winter Quarter, when we
only have two classes together (Finance and Marketing) and need to fill
up more than 50% of our academic calendar with self-selected coures from
GSB and other school. The below 15 factors, in descending order of
importance, might be helpful in strategizing your most optimal course
portfolio, from the perspective of a GSB Sloan.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Iconic Courses</em></p>
<p>These are the signature courses that have achieved immortal status in
Stanford lore. Most Stanford alumni have taken them or at least
auditioned them just so that they can proudly claim they have been to
Stanford. Even non-Stanford people from around the world follow those
courses religiously online from many open-course platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://etl.stanford.edu/">MS&amp;E 472: Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's Seminar
("ETL")</a>  You should make it a ritual to
attend this star-stubbed seminar at 430pm on every Wednesday. This is
the one seminar that rules them all, that bonds all Stanford students
from all the disciplines together. You can also easily get one credit if
you care to. Enrollment is easy as long as you have no scheduling
conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/">CS 106A: Programming
Methodology</a>. Legend has it that
90% of Stanford students have taken this introductory programming
course, which does not require any prior programming experience. We're
in Silicon Valley and Stanford. It just feels wrong not to take this
course to at least understand how coders work and think. Anyone with any
significance in Silicon Valley is most likely linked to Stanford in some
way, and most people have taken CS106A. So you're truly in the company
of some future movers and shakers of our time. While enrolling into this
course for credit with the undergraduates 3 times a week is probably a
bit of a stretch, you can always audition it or watch the online video.
Enrollment is easy as it's a huge lecture class with a roaster of a few
hundred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&amp;filter-coursestatus-Active=on&amp;page=0&amp;catalog=&amp;q=STRAMGT+354%3A+Entrepreneurship+and+Venture+Capital&amp;collapse=">STRAMGT 354: Entrepreneurship and Venture
Capital</a>.
The most sought-after Stanford GSB course, and the most difficult one to
get into. People weep in tears upon the news of enrollment. Valley
extraordinaires Peter Wendell, Andy Rachleff, and Eric Schmidt co-teach
this class. They have enormous pull from Sand Hill Road and Silicon
Valley, and thus regularly invite first-class entrepreneurs and VCs to
the classroom to share their insights. Wendell brought in <a href="http://www.khoslaventures.com/people_vk.html">Vinod
Khosla</a> in the first class
of the quarter last week, as if just to make a statement. You have to
super-round this one to have the chance to get in as every GSBer is
throwing his/her super-round option on this.</p>
</li>

and Entrepreneurial Finance</a>.
The legendary 7-unit course taught by celebrated value investor Jack
McDonald (to give an idea, most courses are 2-3 units; 4 units is
considered pretty heavy; 5 units is very rare; 7 units is out of this
world). If you're going to do investment of any kind, you should try to
enroll into this class. Auditioning attempt will be futile. McDonald has
a photographic memory even at his current age.</p>

Dynamics</a>.
The famous "touchy feely" course in GSB that everyone is talking about.
All my Sloan classmates who are taking this course are raving about it
and many GSBers think this is the single best course in all their GSB
years. As someone who has watched David Finch's Fight Club (1999) many
times, the mere thought of "touch feely” brings up vivid pictures of a
support group therapy session, where everyone is crying over the
shoulders of someone else, and occasionally Edward Norton buries his
head in Meat Loaf's man-boobs...</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Celebrity Professors</em></p>
<p>Many illuminaries, Sillicon legends, Nobel laureates, and billionnaires
walked the corridors of Knight Management Center. There are so many of
them in this pantheon of gods that it'll be almost an insult to them to
single-out any individual ones. There are some larger-than-life
personalities whose mere presence will enthrall people in awe such
as: <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/jmcdonal">Jack McDonald</a> (GSB's
franchise professor), <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/agrove">Andrew
Grove</a> (Intel),
and <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/condi">Condoleezza
Rice</a> (Secretary of State);
there are some glittering entrepreneurs/VCs whose names have been heard
by every GSBer such as <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/pwendell">Peter
Wendell</a>, <a href="http://engineering.stanford.edu/profile/sblank">Steve
Blank</a>, <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/rachleff">Andy
Rachleff</a>, <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/mleslie1">Mark
Leslie</a>, and <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/author/heidi_roizen">Heidi
Roizen</a>; there are many
Nobel winners in GSB, such as <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/mscholes">Myron
Scholes</a> and <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/mspence">A. Michael
Spence</a>; there are also
some filthily rich professor billionaire such as  <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~cheriton/">David
Cheriton</a> (who famously wrote
Google's first check). There are many, many more. You're in Stanford.
Nobody gets to teach here by being less than a superstar in his/her own
right. Even for the professors who classes we don't quite enjoy, I can
see why they can stand here on a solid ground.</p>

Launch</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many think it's a rite of passage to do a startup-themed course in
Stanford - which is probably true, especially for those who haven't done
startup before. The above four are your choices, among which two are
from School of Engineering. Choose them carefully because it's a
significant undertaking. You should expect to spend 15-30 hours a week,
which include class time, many hours of team meetings, and regular
review sessions with assigned mentors. All of them require application
as a team. S356 and S321 are heavy two-quarter commitments (you can
still get out after one quarter but it might create bad will with your
team), while M273 and E245 are one-quarter only. I will try to do a more
in-depth analysis and comparison among these courses in a separate
article. Make sure you choose the right team  (3-4) for these coures
because you'll spend significant hours together, much more than a
typical study group format requires. Grouping with the wrong person for
3 months is much worse than sitting in the wrong class. You sort of
place a big bet of your social capital (ie. time) on 3 people
(Sloan/MBA/engineer) at the expense of the other 70-80 Sloans. Good
luck. Another great benefit of these courses is the mentor the
instructor will assign to you, and the opportunity to pitch to real VCs
for your project. For people who are new to this process, this will be a
great experience to get hands dirty and get a taste of how it's like
working in startups and with VCs. For people who have gone through this
process before, don't get too dizzy with all the shining names from Sand
Hill. It takes several reciprocal transactions to start building a real
business relationship. MBAs have more means at their disposal such as
independent studies, case-writing, teaching assistant etc. As Sloans,
we're in general a bit handicapped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Reasonable Course Portfolio Strategy</em></p>
<p>It's helpful to have a rough roadmap before coming to Stanford Sloan in
terms of what you want to get out of it, then allocate your courses (or,
your tuition) strategically. I suggest strategizing your portfolio of
courses around the below major categories: A) Startup track; B)
Corporate Track; C) Investment Track; D) Social Innovation ; E)
International Politics &amp; Economies;  F) Leadership. G) Communication
(this is for Sloans only. Few Sloans would go Consulting after
graduation). It's advisable to major in only one stream from A to E,
maybe minor in another stream from F to G, then taste the rest with a
surveyor mentality. <em>Do not major in two streams</em>. It will kill your
social calendar and cost you the most valuable asset you can get out of
Sloan program - bonding with other Sloans.</p>
<p><em>A</em> is self-explanatory - you do whatever you want to do in the
wilderness, do 1-2 above mentioned startup course; sign up for every
course that has "entrepreneurship" in its title from every school;
attend weekly ETL religiously; hack your way into Wendell's class; watch
every video from <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/">Stanford's e-Corner</a>;
attend as many Silicon Valley TMT conferences as your budget allows;
enroll into CS106A just to show you're hard-core; and make some young
friends in School of Computer Science or Engineering who only enjoy
coding for the pure pleasure of coding regardless of how lousy the
actual product/service is - which inevitably is designed by you.</p>
<p><em>B</em> is for people with corporate sponsorship or willing to go back to the
corporate environment. Sign up for some bad-ass named courses such as
<a href="http://csi.gsb.stanford.edu/the-paths-to-power">Paths to Power</a>,
Decision for the Future, etc. Minoring in either leadership or
communication goes well with this one.</p>
<p><em>C</em> has three sub-streams: angel/VC investment, private equity investment,
and public investment (hedge fund and portfolio management). They all
lead to very different industry dynamics, practices, and locations so
you want to think carefully before stepping into any stream. Get into
the class of Jack McDonald, Peter Wendell, and Charles Lee. Run for
Sloan Class' Investment Committee officer position. Show up at every
event whenever any member of Stanford Management Company (Stanford's
endowment fund) is present.</p>
<p>D is D. E is a common choice for Sloans sponsored by governments or
coming from family business background.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Flashy One-Timers</em></p>
<p>It's important to take note of some highly desired courses that are only
offered in a particular quarter (due to the availability of the
instructor, who might be attending multiple board meetings or making
movies, or advising US President in the other three quarters). For
example, Jack McDonald's legendary 7-unit course on investment and
entrepreneur finance (Fall Quarter), Leadership in Entertainment
Business (Spring Quarter), and Real-Life Ethics (Fall Quarter). Take
them before they vanish from your academic year's calendar, which is
only one-year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Heavy Two-Quarter Commitments</em>  </p>
<p>Many courses run across two continuous quarters because they use team
projects as the teaching vehicle. Make sure you sign up for the first
leg at the right quarter, otherwise it'll be very difficult to join them
at the second leg. That being said, there are still ways to join the
second leg of some of those courses. For example, when some people drop
from a team after the first leg, a position may become available and the
instructor may want to fill that with someone new just to keep the
group/project/class going.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Confusing Application-Required Courses</em></p>
<p>MyGSB and Axess are the main portals to register for our courses, but
not always. Some courses require application and may not even been
available to register from Axess. There are three types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Registration available on Axess + No application needed. This is easy. Just register on Axess and you're set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration available on Axess + Application needed. Very confusing. You have registered the course on Axess, but you still
have to go through a separate application process outside of Axess to
get enrolled, which means your precious calendar will be taken up by a
course that is not guaranteed to you yet and at the same time might get
in your way for other courses. The Spirit of Entrepreneurship and Lean
Launchpad come to mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration not available on Axess + Application needed Less confusing but more mysterious. They are not on Axess, you have to
go to their own idiosyncratic websites to apply or even go through the
draconian means of ... email. Sloan's staff does a pretty good job on
this and will organize talks before the registration period to highlight
all such courses that need special attention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Evil Exams</em></p>
<p>It helps to go for the electives that have no exams - so that you will
be free in the last exam-week and start your vacation earlier while
others are still sweating on exams. It seems that most electives do not
have exams, but some of them do have, such as Decision for the Future.
Be aware and stay away from those courses, unless you really love them
dearly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Shining Guest Speakers</em></p>
<p>When you evaluate the attractiveness of a course, the quantity and the
quality of its guest speakers are very important. They can make a huge
difference and bring life to an otherwise dreadful classroom session.
They also reflect how influential the professor is and how much pull
he/she's got in the industry and around the Silicon Valley. For many
classes guest speakers are integral part of the teaching, such as Real
Estate Investment, Real-Life Ethics, Entrepreneurship: Formation of New
Ventures, The Spirit of Entrepreneurship, Election 2012, and many more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bright MBAs</em></p>
<p>All the core courses are Sloan-only. Some electives are set up to be
Sloan-only (such as Executive Communications). Most electives have mix
of MBAs and Sloans. Personally it's been an enlightening experience for
me to take many clases with MBAs, who are smart, respectful and mature
(despite of their much younger average age).  I wish I could have spent
more time with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Geeky Coders and Engineers</em></p>
<p>Attend some classes "across the street" from School of Engineering or
School of Computer Science. Stanford GSB students can rival the best
MBAs from any school, including Harvard and Wharton, but still they are
not the prince of the universe here. Don't lose the sight of the fact
that Silicon Valley's culture, wealth, and social pecking order are
defined and ruled by engineers and coders from Stanford. It will pay
long-term dividend to make some friends there and at least understand
how they work and think. Besides attending ETL and CS106A, go to some
seminars/talks organized by Engineering and Computer Science. Don't get
too caught up in Knight Management Center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Personalized Seasonality</em></p>
<p>With many Sloans regularly taking around 20 credits a quarter, it's
fairly easy to satisfy the academic requirements for graduation, which
ask for 56 credits, out of which at least 50 come from GSB. Summer
Quarter is pretty light with only 12 credits (we played many basketball
games then - utterly unthinkable now);  Fall Quarter and Winter Quarter
are the heaviest. You do have some level of discretion about Spring
Quarter. You can either load yourself up to attend as many classes as
you can to make good on your \$108,000 tuition investment, or go by with
only 11 credits - the lowest credits you have to maintain to qualify as
a full-time student.  You can free up yourself to pursue other things in
life, such as landing a job, finding a significant other, starting a
business, or making some babies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Manageable Team Relationships</em></p>
<p>Almost every class requires some sort of grouping. So we always end up
in 4-6 different groups in Fall/Winter/Spring Quarter. Most of them are
only called for on as-needed basis when group project deliverables are
approaching. However, be aware that some groups are quite heavy-lifting
and require significant investment in time and emotion (like "Touchy
Feely") due to the nature of the group projects. All the startup-themed
classes, as well as the assigned study group for Finance and Marketing,
fall into this category. Depending what kind of people you end up with
in your groups, some groups choose to meet as little as possible and
some groups prefer to do everything together. Welcome to B-school, where
drama never ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Forgotten Audition</em></p>
<p>Do not forget to audit. Many a time you're not able to enroll into a
particular class for reasons such as, you max out your 22 credits for
the quarter, the class is full, it conflicts with other classes on your
calendar, etc. You can still sit in for those classes as long as the
instructor permits. You sit in the back row; do not raise your hand; no
participation, no homework, no grade; you're just a spectator - this is
auditing. I would always audit for Wendell's class as long as I'm not
completely burned out. With so many intellectually stimulating classes
opening their doors to you left and right, it'll be a crime and waste of
your tuition money if you don't do any auditing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Precious Wednesday</em></p>
<p>Last and the least, try to keep your Wednesday free of any class except
ETL, which is always on Wednesday afternoon. Sloan staff usually
schedules program-related activities on Wednesday, such as important
announcements or class meetings. Many study groups schedule their weekly
session on Wednesday.  You should also leave some room for yourself for
interviews, out-of-town trips. An inconveniently timed class on
Wednesday might screw up all such schedules and make you very unpopular
in general.</p>
