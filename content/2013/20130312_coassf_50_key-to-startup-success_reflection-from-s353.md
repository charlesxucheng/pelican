Summary: In my last post on this subject, I compared some similarities and differences between S353 (Entrepreneurship: Formation of New Business) and G566 (Real-Life Ethics), two of my favorite GSB courses. Today's S353 class presented the last case in this series of 18 very different and interesting startup stories. So after all the discussions, what kind of lessons can we draw from them?

In my last post on this subject, I compared some [similarities and
differences between S353 (Entrepreneurship: Formation of New
Business)  and G566 (Real-Life
Ethics)](../../../2013/02/comparison-S353-and-G566-in-GSB/),
two of my favorite GSB courses. Today's S353 class presented the last
case in this series of 18 very different and interesting startup
stories. So after all the discussions, what kind of lessons can we draw
from them?

Before George and Jim give us a summary on Thursday, I just want to
share my own takeaways. I call them "**PPT**".

I find these three qualities are not only exemplified throughout all the
18 S353 cases we have reviewed, but also demonstrated in all the startup
success stories that I personally know of, whether in US, Europe or
China. There are many other situational factors or circumstantial
strategies that were also instrumental to the success for those
founders, but in the grand scheme of all things those more "operational"
factors tend to wash out and become no more than a white noise in the
distribution of a seemingly random walk. What stand out in the end as
the true significant drivers and the common denominators of all, are
*Patience*, *Perseverance*, and *Tenacity*.

It's worth noting that Passion is not part of this by my account, which
might surprise some people. I think passion is definitely and obviously
a common attribute to many successful founders, and the value of passion
is that it brings tenacity. Many people have enough passion, but if that
cannot be translated into **PPT**, the venture would still fail. On the
contrary, we've seen enough successful founders in S353 that don't
appear to have built their businesses with a particular passion for the
product/service/business model, but they got sufficient PPT to live
through the peaks and valleys and that's what gives their stories to an
eventual happy ending.
