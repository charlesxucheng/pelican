Summary: My final evaluation for the Fall Quarter courses, following the CIDRAE framework I developed in the summer. It's a somewhat scientific approach to validate my favorite courses: Real-life Ethics, Election 2012, Political Communication, Organization Behavior, and Generative Leadership.

My final evaluation for the Fall Quarter courses, following the CIDRAE
framework I developed in the summer. It's a somewhat scientific approach
to validate my favorite courses: Real-life Ethics, Election 2012,
Political Communication, Organization Behavior, and Generative
Leadership.

My final group presentation in Executive Communication was critiqued by
several judges of local Sloan alumni. We had a pleasant chat with one of
the judges after the team presentation, a young Sloan alumni with curly
hair, who gave us some thoughtful feedback. After getting through the
business stuff our conversation went casual and off the path. Seemingly
randomly he asked who had taken Real-Life Ethics. I identified myself
and went on a lengthy and passionate speech of flowery praise about how
much I enjoyed that class thoroughly and loved the instructor Mark
Leslie.

At the end of my speech, he smiled at me, I'm glad to hear that, Mark is
my father.
