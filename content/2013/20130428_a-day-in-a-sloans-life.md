Summary: I have done a lot of presentations in my life, from participating in an English speech contest for high-school students broadcast live on China's national television (CCTV) at age 15, to delivering a company presentation on China's largest VC/PE firm - CDH's annual LP conference in Venetian, Macau. This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a "ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before it in dust. It was finished right at the very last second before class president John Barton finished his introduction of me.

The music is *Robert Miles' Children (Dream Version)*. The pictures came
from a variety of sources, including Her Extraordinaire Ede Tamkivi and
Jacqueline Wu, two best photographers of our class.

This is the way I've always imagined our story should be told.
