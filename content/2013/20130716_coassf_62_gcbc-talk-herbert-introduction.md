Summary: This was a organized by Stanford GSB's Greater China Business Student Club. The talk was scheduled during the final exam week of the Spring Quarter between some terrifying exams. Thank you my friends who showed up for this event and engaged me in a spirited conversation about movies, rock band, flash mob, China, and leadership.

This was a organized by Stanford GSB's Greater China Business Student Club (thanks
to Xinkai and Rainey). The talk was scheduled during the final exam week
of the Spring Quarter between some terrifying exams. Thank you my
friends who showed up for this event and engaged me in a spirited
conversation about movies, rock band, flash mob, China, and leadership.

Thanks to Weining who recorded the clip faithfully. This truncated
footage actually works out to be a reasonable self-introduction that I
can probably recycle for other occasions. It helps me to stay concise,
one of the qualities I'm still aspiring to work on.
