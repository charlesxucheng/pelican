Summary: Short version for index and feed

I've been thinking about evaluating each course I've taken in [Stanford
Sloan Program](http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sloan) individually, but I'm
afraid that my often highly opinionated remarks would hurt some feelings
and doom my future career in the Silicon Valley. So I developed a
framework during today's less-than-eventful class, called **CIDRAE,** to
express a more balanced and comprehensive critique for each course. My
idea was inspired from the group exercise project (the U Penn PhD
curriculum one) for a course in the Fall Quarter [GSBGEN239 Executive
Communication
Strategies](http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&q=GSBGEN+239%3A+Sloan%3A+Executive+Communication+Strategies&collapse=). 

**Contents Usefulness: **How useful are the contents? How relevant are
they to me? Are they what I want to learn?

**Instructor's Presentation: **Is the instructor inspiring? Is his
presentation creative, engaging, or conducive for learning?

**Dynamics in Classroom: **Is there usually a spirited discussion or
debate among students in the class? Are students proactively sharing
their views and experiences to enhance the overall learning for the
class?

**Reading Load: **How heavy is the reading material? Are they compulsory
or optional?

**Assignment/Project Load: **How heavy is the work load from assignments
and projects (individual and group)?

**Exam Pressure: **How stressful is it to prepare for the exam? How
menacing does the exam look like? How much psychological pressure does
it impose on me?

C, I, D more or less measure how much I get out of the course, and R, A,
E measure how much effort I need to put into the course. For every
course, I'll measure it under these six dimensions and assign a value
from 1 to 5. 5 is the highest extend, and 1 is the lowest extend. Also
it's worth noting that RAE reflects how I treat the course requirement,
rather than what is officially required by the syllabus. The entire
CIDRAE score is, therefore, highly idiosyncratic.

Denote:

**CID Index** = Sum (C +  I + D) / 3

**RAE Index **= Sum (R + A + E) / 3

**CIDRAE Index** = CID Index / RAE Index
