<p>I won’t do justice to the below chart that I drew up a few days ago in
my attempt to summarize Apple’s consumer strategy if I don’t follow up
with a more detailed elaboration. I’ll just use English given the
petty-sized Chinese Mac community (most Chinese websites based in
Mainland have very poor compatibility with Apple platform, reflecting
the fact that most Chinese website designers there (and obviously
99.9999% of the consumers) probably never use a Mac before, which is
just a sad sad situation)</p>
<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gankyun/480614266/in/photolist-JtgSS" title="The Unofficial Apple&#x27;s Consumer Strategy"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/231/480614266_79344d4d98_z.jpg?zz&#x3D;1" width="640" height="481" alt="The Unofficial Apple&#x27;s Consumer Strategy"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This chart can be viewed from a few different angles:</p>
<h2>Where We Are</h2>
<p>Apple’s current offering already covers study room (iMac) and living
room (AppleTV); static state (iMac) and mobile state (Macbook); indoor
and outdoor (iPod). With the addition of iPhone, Apple is posed to
become the 24/7 soul mate for the consumer no matter where he is at and
no matter what he is doing. It’s no secret that Apple makes most of its
money on hardware. Its journey on that path is pretty remarkable  if you
think about the fact that until iPod’s birth in 2001, Apple only had
Macintosh desktops/powerbooks to compete with the ubiquitous PC/windows
combo. Seeing that it was a mission impossible to upstage the 95% market
leader, Apple shrewdly ventured into an off-the-beaten path of the MP3
player domain. By commanding lion’s share of the player market and
opening up iTunes for Windows, it successfully converted hordes of new
fans like me. Convinced how cool Apple’s application was, many naturally
bought big-ticket items like iMac/Powerbook/Macbook and never looked
back at PC/Windows since.</p>
<p>In retrospective, that curve ball strategy was certainly a stroke of
genius and is now stuff of legend. With the full line-up we’re about to
witness in June (iPhone), Apple will be in position to launch the
greatest counter-strike ever. Forget about all the exciting
functionalities (most of which are not revenue streams) for a second,
iPhone’s importance lies in its ability to drive iMac/Macbook sales. Why
it has a shot of doing that? Because it syncs. It syncs with iTunes on
existing Macs and potentially it can sync with AppleTV (my speculation)
so that you can control your entire Internet experience without stepping
out of your living room (assuming your Macs are in a separate study).</p>
<h2>What We Can Have</h2>
<p>iTunes is over-due for a name change, obviously (my suggestions are
iCosmo,  iVerse, iSphere… yeah..very lame, I know. iLife is actually
very good, but it’s already taken by Apple itself). One key factor in
iPod’s success is the vast amount of contents available through iTunes.
I think eventually we can pretty much have everything through Mac
applications. Just list down all the non-interactive information you
ever want to have by the medium it’s presented through. Music, checked;
video/movie, checked; TV programs, checked; images, checked (iPhoto);
radio, checked. Let’s fill the blank now. What else is missing? Books?
Bingo!</p>
<p>iPod is too small for book-reading, but iPhone has the right size to
serve as an excellent book reader with its relatively large screen. I’m
usually not a huge fan for digital book reader as I feel there is
something unique about flipping through freshly minted pages. But if
this market will ever take off, I’ll give my benefit of doubt to Steve
Jobs and the Co. (sorry Sony, not you).</p>
<p>Of course, unlike the music/movie markets where content ownership is
highly consolidated into a few hands, book market is extremely
fragmented with ownership all over the place. So it’ll be a much bigger
challenge in terms of negotiations, logistics and operations. That’s
another discussion for another day.</p>
<h2>What We Can Do</h2>
<p>iPhone will be the ultimate all-in-one enabler of various applications
that we can’t live without. Even with the meteorite rise of iPod,
Apple’s value to consumer is still primarily on what contents consumer
can GET. iPod is not designed to offer sophisticated interaction or
contents creation. It just retrieves contents and presents them in a
very efficient manner. With iPhone, Apple’s prowess in tightly
integrated softwares will be fully unleashed. Now we can actually do
many things, or,should I say, everything. Below are just a few low
hanging fruits:</p>
<h3>1. Full PIM (personal information management) solution</h3>
<p>This will be the holy grail for many users, especially the business
ones. It has three main elements: contacts, calendar and to-do list.
Right now consumer often has 5 different places for them: PDA, cell
phone, PC from work, PC/Mac from home, and web (gmail/yahoo). To sync
all of them, in all directions while maintaining full interactivity on
each device,  is an insurmountable task. The technical difficulty of
synchronization increases exponentially with each additional device.
iPhone can combine PDA + cell phone + home machine + web (gmail contacts
potentially can have two-way sync with Apple’s Addressbook. Not easy
though.).</p>
<p>In addition, iPhone not only can reduce  the number of devices, but also
may offer information aggregation from multiple angles. If you click on
a contact’s profile, it’ll show all his emails, all his voice messages,
all the chat scripts, all the photos, all the podcasts, all the meeting
requests involving him, and all the to-do items assigned to him. That,
my friend, is the future.</p>
<h3>2. Geocoding &amp; Maping</h3>
<p>Web 2.0 applications such as flickr.com and maps.google.com have made
geocoding/geotagging possible. The future vision is that you click on a
place on the map, you can see all the photos, videos and related
contents right there. The bottleneck seems to be logging the GPS
figures. It’s still very expensive to get a GPS-embedded camera, or a
portable GPS receiver with display. Like many other Mac fans, I’m
guessing that iPhone will be GPS-enabled very soon. This is how it
works: you use iPhone to take a photo; save that with GPS data into
iPhoto; send the photo to Google Map/Flickr; then IM the link of the
address to your buddies - all done on iPHone. I won’t go much further
here. Once you have a smartphone + GPS + Map, you can virtually do a
million different things, and I’ll just leave the rest to your
imagination.</p>
<h3>3. Gaming</h3>
<p>What does iPhone look like? Nintendo DS and Sony PSP. Hah, now we’re
talking. Paul thinks that Apple should just acquire Nintendo and I
totally agree. Putting aside the trivial operational and cultural
challenge (which is besides the point) and just for the pure of fun of
intellectual debate, Apple and Nintendo is a match made in heaven. Both
excel in home-grown, enclosed products and both handle hardware-software
integration very well. Many of Nintendo’s DS games, which require
touch-screen,  can be potentially adapted to the iPhone screen.</p>
<p>There has long been a debate on whether Apple should position itself as
a game machine. There are two trends that are clearly emerging. One,
game consoles are morphing into multi-media entertainment centers; two,
interactive on-line games are re-defining what is game, who plays them,
and who will pay for them (just look at the phenomenal success of world
of warcraft and second life, and their impact on the mainstream
society).  AppleTV + iTunes + iPhone will be Apple’s response to the
attack from Xbox 360 and PS3 on the first trend, and iPhone with wi-fi +
Nintendo can provide Apple a leap frog into the highly lucrative
online/casual gaming market. If my memory serves me right, gaming
industry’s total revenue already surpassed that of Hollywood since 2005.
For such an industry whose rapidly-expanding boundary keeps challenging
people’s conventional wisdom and traditional expectations, Apple should
really get a decent slice of that.</p>
<h3>4. Pushed Contents: RSS and Emails</h3>
<p>At the moment “push” technology is being used on some email services,
like corporate emails for Blackberry and the coming-soon Yahoo email for
iPhone. I envision one day it will also be deployed to RSS applications
like Google Reader and Bloglines on a mobile device. In an age when
people only care to watch the first 20 seconds of movies on youtube,
RSS, along with Google Reader, has totally changed my way of reading
Internet news. ’nuff said. Just fire up your iPhone and read your RSS
feeds there. Plain and simple. Hold on. There is one more twist. Another
blank spot on Apple’s strategy landscape is enterprise solutions.
Blackberry is still very resilient because it can push Outlook emails to
satisfy the needs for business users in large companies. However, what
if Apple works with Google to push gmail to iPhone (I don’t have much
faith in Yahoo’s ability to do anything exciting), and what if companies
can migrate their group collaboration applications to Google Appls
(already happening) and abandon Outlook? It’s a fairly long shot but a
very possible scenario. iPhone, potentially can be Apple’s spring board
to break into the enterprise customers.</p>
<h3>5. Instant Messaging and Skype</h3>
<p>Another fiercely-contested market where iPhone’s unique wi-fi capability
can fully leverage Apple’s existing application that is well-designed
but sparsely used. Yahoo Chat is already available on Blackberry. iChat
is the best chatting client but few people, even among Mac users (Adium
seems a more popular choice), are using it. It should get on iPhone
while improving its jabbar protocal to better work with MSN, Yahoo and
Gtalk users. It can be done today on a Mac but the cumbersome procedure
is not for the average users. The hard part of the IM market is how you
can milk money out of it. Skype could be a good source of additional
revenue for Apple. There is already fully-fledged IP skype phone. Why
not just use iPhone to call your skype buddies?</p>
<p>Having said all these, iPhone’s main use is still to drive hardware
sales for iMac/Macbook as mentioned earlier.  All the nice contents and
fancy capabilities are right now just various parts of a seamless and
holistic  user experience, but they do enable us to glimpse into how
Apple can shape our life in future while making a killing commercially.
That future is beautiful.</p>
<p>By the way, you can also make phone calls with iPhone.</p>
<p>So...whew, long story short, that’s my take on what Apple’s strategy can
be.</p>
