      <p>When you see Sloans dancing on the table in usually low-key Stanford Coho cafe, you know this party is a riot. This is the TGIF that ends all other TGIFs. This is The-Moment-Of-The-Year for Sloan Fellow Class of 2013 of Stanford Graduate Business School. Thank you, my bandmates of Sloan's house band The Spillovers, we did it!</p>

      <p>In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation, the maker of highly successful franchises of “Shrek” and “Madagascar”, laid off 350 of its 2,200 employees. The restructuring was driven by disappointing results of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446192/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Rise of the Guardians</a>, which forced the studio to take $87 Million charge. The shocking news begs the question: what’s wrong with DreamWorks Animation Studio, or what’s wrong with animation film business in general? Animation film business has always been a hit-driven model. What happens when the streak ends and a hit becomes a dud? Animation film industry has had a great run in the last 20 years. Pixar’s cultural phenomenon Toy Story (1995) marked the arrival of 3D animation. Since then several specialized animation studios have emerged and become dominant players in this space, such as Pixar, DreamWorks Animation, and Blue Sky (Fox). They have created some of the most recognized global brands from Hollywood, such as Toy Story, Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, and Ice Age. Pixar’s unbelievable streak of 13 hits in a row has become the stuff of legend not only in Hollywood, but also in the entire business world.</p>

      <p>By 2007 I had tried out every career assessment tool or personality test there was in the market.   Those tests were helpful to some extent, but the overall value was limited, at least for me. Unsatisfied with what was available, I started developing a more effective framework/methodology to find out the key drivers that may explain why I like doing certain things more than others and figure out what would be my best career choice given what I want.</p>

      <p>I have done a lot of presentations in my life, from participating in an English speech contest for high-school students broadcast live on China's national television (CCTV) at age 15, to delivering a company presentation on China's largest VC/PE firm - CDH's annual LP conference in Venetian, Macau. This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a "ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before it in dust. It was finished right at the very last second before class president John Barton finished his introduction of me.</p>

      <p>In descending order of importance, Complete your Linkedin profile. Linkedin has been used extensively by business schools, head hunters, and HR recruitment officers of many companies in US. It's gone mainstream and become a must-have in Stanford GSB. If you're looking for a job after Stanford, you can probably afford not to have a Facebook account, but you can't afford to have no Linkedin account. Linkedin helps to validate your professional history and it currently owns this market space. Get your personal linkedin URL and don't use the default system-generated random link, which no one remembers and looks amateurish. Spend quality time to polish and complete the Linkedin profile. A well updated Linkedin profile takes long time to fine-tune.</p>

      <p>It was a very pleasant surprise when I read the back page of 2013 Spring Issue of Stanford Business Magazine. Surprise #1, this was actually a very accurate quote from me, though I have no idea how the magazine got it. Surprise #2, the editor thoughtfully used my previous Facebook profile photo instead of the current Jack Sparrow one ... nice touch there.</p>

      <p>As I was burning midnight oil on my final assignment/personal essay for S353, I finally could not help but laying out my entire career transitions, in the past, present, and future, on a diagram - something I've been thinking about doing for a long time but never got the chance to complete. This diagram is built on a framework I developed a while ago, which was written in Chinese and I haven't got the chance to translate into English (if you know of any free secretary service, please let me know. I can certainly use one or two.)</p>

      <p>In my last post on this subject, I compared some similarities and differences between S353 (Entrepreneurship: Formation of New Business) and G566 (Real-Life Ethics), two of my favorite GSB courses. Today's S353 class presented the last case in this series of 18 very different and interesting startup stories. So after all the discussions, what kind of lessons can we draw from them?</p>

      <p>On February 8, 2013, I emceed Sloan's Chinese New Year Party, which made history by becoming the most attended self-organized Sloan event with roughly 180 people (120 adults + 60 kids), in true Chinese fashion. We squeezed out every inch in Havana Room but still could not find enough chairs/tables for all the Sloans and the partners. The party followed a format that was familiar to every Mainland Chinese - a gala filled with delicious food, baijiu (Chinese white wine, very hard-core liquor), stage performances, and variety shows. Not only it was a banquet of food and drink, but also it was a total cultural immersion of three hours in which I walked through five parts of some interesting elements of Chinese culture.</p>
