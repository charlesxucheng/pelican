	<div class="summary"><p>By 2007 I had tried out every career assessment tool or personality test there was in the market.   Those tests were helpful to some extent, but the overall value was limited, at least for me. Unsatisfied with what was available, I started developing a more effective framework/methodology to find out the key drivers that may explain why I like doing certain things more than others and figure out what would be my best career choice given what I want.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="./posts/2013/05/drivers-of-your-life/">more…</a>

This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a "ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before it in dust. It was finished right at the very last second before class president John Barton finished his introduction of me.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="./posts/2013/04/a-day-in-a-sloans-life/">more…</a>

This diagram is built on a framework I developed a while ago, which was written in Chinese and I haven't got the chance to translate into English (if you know of any free secretary service, please let me know. I can certainly use one or two.)</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="./posts/2013/03/an-entrepreneurs-manifesto-POOOUA-model/">more…</a>

Today's S353 class presented the last case in this series of 18 very different and interesting startup stories. So after all the discussions, what kind of lessons can we draw from them?</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="./posts/2013/03/key-to-startup-success/">more…</a>

	<div class="summary"><p>One of the benefits of sitting right next to my Sloan-mate Nicki Carter, who is co-leading an admirable and spirited effort of publishing Yearbook of Sloan Class of 2013,  is that I can rest assured to receive regular reminder about my yearbook message status for no less than ... four times a week. After leading Nicki's "Hall of Shame" for many weeks in a row, I decided to redeem  myself in front of Nicki and get it over with. For someone with a petty education background prior to Stanford, I actually don't think I've ever written a yearbook message before. So I did a bit of research to see what this whole yearbook message thing is about in US, and I've arrived at the following takeaways</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="./posts/2013/03/my-yearbook-message-for-Stanford-Sloan/">more…</a>
