You might see some missing files, broken links, or just out-of-alignment here and there. That's because I'm still cleaning up the files from their xml format to streamline everything into strictly &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; format. If you have been a reader of my site before, there is no new content created after Mar 21, 2014. What gives then? Not a lot for you, but a great deal to me. I will write an article about this transformation later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find any error or any format that you think is less than perfect in any page, please feel free to leave a comment on that page or this page so that I can fix it right away. Thank you in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website is the publishing platform for all contents created by &lt;a href="www.linkedin.com/in/herbertyang‎"&gt;Herbert Yang&lt;/a&gt;, which includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blog articles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;photo galleries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;performance videos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;slide presentations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain name "guizishanren" is "&lt;em&gt;桂子山人&lt;/em&gt;" in Chinese, of which the literal translation will be "The Person from Mt. Sweet Olive". Mt. Sweet Olive in Wuhan, China is where I grew up in China. Wuhan is about 1.5 hour by flight to both Beijing and Shanghai, and is the largest city in Central China who almost became and definitely should have become the capital city of China in 1949. It was a tragedy afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of this site pays tribute to movie "&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/?ref_=nv_sr_2"&gt;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&lt;/a&gt;" by great &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001466/?ref_=tt_ov_dr"&gt;Sergio Leone&lt;/a&gt;, one of the greatest movies of all time. The soundtrack is just as epic and has become a frequent rip-off target by Quentin Tarantino ever since. Here's Metallica cover of the most famous song from the soundtrack, "&lt;em&gt;The Ecstasy of Gold&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

Graduate School of Business (GSB)'s BLAST mailing list, which is
subscribed by all GSB students (MBA, MSx and PhD) and used heavily by
the student community to broadcast news, seeking help, etc. The idea is
similar to Google Keyword Trend, except that it's applied to a very
specific environment and audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../../images/buzzGSB.png" alt="Buzz Word from Stanford GSB" width="800px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program is written in Python 2.7.5 and &lt;a href="https://github.com/zire/buzzInStanfordGSB"&gt;the source code is on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download all the BLAST emails&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately Google provides a very handy Datatool to download emails
with specific labels. It's available from the Account Settings page.
This archive has emails from 2012 (I recovered them from Trash), 2013,
and 2014. Emails in 2012 and 2013 were not preserved universally and
consistently so they will not be part of this analysis. Emails in 2014
are of better quality though I'm sure I've missed/deleted some BLAST
messages already. Going forward I will keep all the BLAST emails and the
data quality will be considerably better in more recent update&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extract emails and dates from the email archive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google archives Gmail messages in mbox format - one single large file.
Python's mailbox.mbox library provides an effective way to extract
contents from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_mbox2csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are three steps that need to be performed here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;figure out where is the email body with get_payload()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that all the BLAST emails are of multipart (so get_payload() will return a list, not a string). The email body is hidden in the first part of the first part in a message from mbox (quite nested).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;clean up the date field&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raw date field needs clean-up. It's not in the standard ISO format
and the day field is not zero-paddled. Datetime.strptime is used to deal
with it. Eventually a raw date like "5 Nov 2013" is converted into
"20131105" (YYYYMMDD) for easy sorting in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sort data by date&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-explanatory. After this program is run, a cleaned up email archive
will be created in csv format with only date and email body information,
and is sorted by date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the word frequency analysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_wordcount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After all the maneuvers to get the data into the right format, the real
crunching on word frequency is quite easy relatively speaking. The true
magic that embodies both science and art is the exception list of words
to ignore (words_to_ignore). A lot of time was spent to grow this list
so that all the un-informational words are filtered out such as "when",
"where", "to".. etc. There are A LOT of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's only after filtering out those exception words, the real buzzwords
for Stanford GSB will float to the surface, as you can see from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do they reveal something useful? Maybe, but I'm not sure. Maybe I just
need to continue to tinker with the exception word list to make more
sense out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term=""></category></entry><entry><title>Hiking at Joseph D.

and reflect what was it that we tried to get out of this incredible
experience, I think our goals fall into six mutually exclusive and
collective exhaustive categories, namely, &lt;strong&gt;PFIKER&lt;/strong&gt;. It is important
for us to know what our goals are, from Day One into the community, so
that we can strategize priorities, plan our academic and social life
accordingly, to get the most out of our time in Stanford. 12 months go
by really, really fast. Without clear goals in mind, it's easy to let
the time and opportunities slip through our fingers before we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../../images/Goals.png", width="800px" alt="Goals in Stanford"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;artner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us are looking for partners, in business or in life. For
business partners, spend more time with alumni, in study groups, social
gatherings and pay attention to those who tend to take initiatives/run
for class officers. Take one of the four major startup-themed classes to
interact with students from Computer Science (CS) and Engineering, who
are the real movers and shakers of the Silicon Valley. For life
partners, spend more time with MBAs starting from the Autumn Quarter.
It's ok to date another Sloan, but it might get tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;riend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us are looking for new friends, from new cultures, from new
industries, from new interest areas. Regularly hang out in the Sloan
Study Rooms ("Slounge") and make sure leave the door open, attend all
the TGIFs, join all the study trips (the Seatle one, the East Coast one,
and the self-organized international one), and take the initiatives to
organize small-party dinners (six person is the ideal size). Running for
social chairs will also help you make friends quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;nspiration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us are looking for inspirations that connect dots, bridge
isolated domains of knowledge, expand our horizon, or provide that
"eureka" moments. Attend &lt;a href="http://etl.stanford.edu/"&gt;Wednesday's ETL&lt;/a&gt; in
Engineering School religiously, attend as many seminars, talks, BBLs in
and around GSB as possible. Take some classes outside of GSB. Attend
industry conferences around Silicon Valley by taking advantages of
student discounts. Read the blog by &lt;a href="http://sten.tamkivi.com/"&gt;Sten&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://guizishanren.com/"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt;nowledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us are looking for knowledge, things that we have never been
exposed to in prior jobs. Max out the cap level of 22 credits
Autumn/Winter/Spring and audit as many classes as schedule allows. If
your Sloan classmates can still remember your name by Spring Quarter,
you should consider yourself a big failure in this regard - OK.. that's
a bad joke. The point is that if you're so academically inclined, you
can never study hard enough and Stanford has enough interesting courses
to keep you intellectually stimulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;xperience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us are looking for the quintessential "Stanford" experience and
try to experience as many actions as possible that Stanford can offer.
Run for a class officer role - whatever it is, as long as it helps to
serve the Sloan class and GSB community. Attend all the sports events in
the summer and the autumn (the football season is only in the
summer-autumn quarter I think). Take some physical exercise classes in
Winter and Spring Quarter, like golfing, horse-riding, yoga, or
swimming. Join some student's clubs. Participate in a flash mob if
someone in your class has the balls and guts to actually organize that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;eputation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us are looking to establish a personal brand that people can
remember us by. I think the importance of reputation cannot be
overstated. However it seems to have been ignored by many. GSB
(including 80+ Sloans and around 800 MBAs) is a very competitive
environment (duh....) and Sloans have only one year to leave our marks.
If you don't do something to put your name out there, people will not
remember you - plain and simple, and you don't want people at the end of
day to comment you along the lines of "yeah, he's a really nice guy...".
There are just too many overachievers around the campus in all
disciplines. Since you've already made it all the way up here, you might
as well just try a bit harder to get more mileage out of this journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the top 3 priorities are Inspiration, Reputation, and Partner.
That pretty much explains why and why not I did certain things when in
Stanford, for whoever is curious about it. I come from a very heavy
business/finance background with extensive global trails and mix of
corporate/startup experience. Not too many courses in GSB are completely
new to me, nor do I really want to refresh my memory in Accounting,
Economics, or Statistics. So I tried to minimize my study load and free
up myself to do other things. I've lived in too many countries before to
care about checking all the boxes to make sure I've "been there, done
that", not to mention I&lt;a href="http://guizishanren.com/why-here-why-now-why-again/"&gt;was planning to settle down in the Bay
area&lt;/a&gt; even before I
came to Stanford.  Why Inspiration, Reputation, and Partner? &lt;a href="http://guizishanren.com/confession-of-a-stanford-sloan-fellow_35_my-bbl/"&gt;My

Leadership in Entertainment Business, my group researched and analyzed
the success of K-Pop. During this exhilarating intellectual process, I
came up with this graph that illustrates how to find the optimal path of
nurturing a star from scratch. The horizontal dimension, from low to
high, represents the technical difficulty of acquiring certain skills
(which are also the cultural products those stars will eventually
produce) for a star in an entertainment business. The vertical
dimension, from low to high, represents  the cultural barrier those
cultural products will encounter when they are delivered to a foreign
culture (like from South Korea to America).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../../images/Star-Making.png" width="800px" alt="How to make a star"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why for K-Pop stars, they all start with dancing and singing.
It's called Audiovisuality. It gets more difficult after that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term=""></category></entry><entry><title>COASSF#55 - GCBC Talk - Stay Full Stay Smart</title><link href="http://guizishanren.com/posts/2013/05/stay-full-stay-smart/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-28T00:19:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Herbert Yang</name></author><id>tag:guizishanren.com,2013-05-28:posts/2013/05/stay-full-stay-smart/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;GCBC Talk Series: &lt;em&gt;Stay Full, Stay Smart&lt;/em&gt;, by Herbert Yang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hulk&lt;/em&gt; - a career from CFO to movie producer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sense and Sensibility&lt;/em&gt; - how to tell stories with your pictures?&lt;/p&gt;

don't expect more than 10-15 people to show up. I'll pick up some topics
that the audience are most interested in, during this prolonged late

maybe save Wong Kar Wai for the non-business part, for later.&lt;/p&gt;

The full "choose life ... " monologue starts at 02:38.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2007 I had tried out every career assessment tool or personality test
there was in the market.   Those tests were helpful to some extent, but
the overall value was limited, at least for me. Unsatisfied with what
was available, I started developing a more effective
framework/methodology to find out the key drivers that may explain why I
like doing certain things more than others and figure out what would be
my best career choice given what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time I was &lt;a href="../../../2007/08/leaving-GE/"&gt;on my way out of General Electric
(GE)&lt;/a&gt;. GE taught
me everything I knew and I was eternally grateful for an exceptionally
enriching professional experience it had bestowed me with. However I
found myself gradually leaning toward a direction that would obviously
deviate from the trajectory that GE had always designed for me. I was
looking for my true self and didn't want to just fall into a pre-defined
category that others presumed I belonged to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quest for the ultimate answer to this ultimate question seems like a
universal one (unfortunately, the answer is not as easy as ... 42).
 Many of my friends all over the world are searching for it, and many of
my classmates in &lt;a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/msx/"&gt;Stanford Sloan
Fellow&lt;/a&gt; master program are also
searching for it. As we walk through 30s, the most productive years of
our life, having bounced around several career tracks in the past, many
of us were taking a pulse asking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I really enjoy my current job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this the right career for me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I really pursue in my life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not be respectful to address these questions without mentioning
the monumental theoretical work by Maslow, who proposed his landmark
paper in 1943 "A Theory of Human Motivation". The famous "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs"&gt;Maslow's
Pyramid&lt;/a&gt;",
which depicts hierarchy of needs, is well known. I got a taste of that
from the Social-Psychology class in my undergraduate days in &lt;a href="http://nus.edu.sg/"&gt;National
University of Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. The five layers of human
motivations, Physiological-Safety-Love/Belonging-Esteem-Self
Actualization, are probably the most widely quoted framework on this
subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all due respect to Maslow, I didn't feel his pyramid was sufficient
to explain drivers at deeper levels. His five layers are perfectly
correct, and do a good job explaining social behaviors by different
social classes in the same country or across different countries, but
that's not the area where most of my peers are struggling. Most people
who actually can afford the luxury to contemplate this question, are
struggling with drivers/motivations embedded in the top
"Self-Actualization" layer, which warrants a much more in-depth
analysis. We have to peel the onion even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another often-mentioned deep question is &lt;em&gt;What Gives You Happiness&lt;/em&gt;.
 Harvard's insanely popular course Psychology 1504 "Positive Psychology"
(aka, the "Happiness Course") has made a name for itself since 2006.
However I feel it's still left much to be answered. The question on
Happiness is not the same as the question on What Drives You to Do
Certain Things. Health, family time, California sunshine, these are the
obvious answers to Happiness and no one can dispute them - which means
they are not really particularly useful in solving our puzzle. In a very
tacky sense, we need to find out the fundamental drivers that make us
choose certain careers over others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, while I’m at it, I would define happiness as a kind of
sensation that you can derive totally independent from any
externalities. This simple and beautiful definition leads to many
implications, such as that money does not give you happiness (because
money is an externality), or that only spiritual enlightenment can bring
out true happiness, etc. Another definition I sometimes use, in a joking
fashion, is Happiness = Capability / Desire, which is pretty neat and
conveniently incorporates psychological expectation. Anyway, the
question of happiness is a different discussion all together. Let’s move
on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I don't think discussing &lt;em&gt;How To Be Successful&lt;/em&gt; is of much help.
Success is an over-rated and excessively discussed topic. Most people
tend to associate success with money, fame, achievement and getting up
on social ladder. People from different classes and cultures have vastly
different views on success and thus most discussions on success have
very limited mileage. To me success is to have the freedom to do what
one wants to without feeling constrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the same token, I don't think this topic should be mixed with &lt;em&gt;What
Is Your Passion&lt;/em&gt;. Passion is closest to Driver, but not quite the same.
Passion sometimes borderlines with interests and interests are not
necessarily the fundamental drivers at our deepest psychological level.
Passion implies that people have a strong urge to do certain things, and
I feel many people don't really have that in them. But everyone has some
drivers, even for those with no noticeable passion in anything. Passion
is an often over-rated concept, especially in b-schools. In those
successful entrepreneurs I’ve known or heard about, &lt;a href="../../../2013/03/key-to-startup-success/"&gt;patience,
perseverance, and
tenacity&lt;/a&gt;are
the three most important attributes. Having passion definitely helps,
but I don’t feel it’s a necessary condition of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in 2007 I developed a &lt;strong&gt;SIMPLERK&lt;/strong&gt; method to help myself address
these questions. I found it useful in providing me with a consistent
guiding principle when making major career decisions. The assessment on
myself in 2007 has since withheld the test of time and is still valid
today. Over the years I've applied the same method on many friends. I
think most if not all my friends have found it useful to some extent as
well. For some of them, &lt;strong&gt;SIMPLERK&lt;/strong&gt; also revealed something in them
that they did not realize before, which came as a surprise with mixed
feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how I use my SIMPLERK method to solve the puzzle, once and for
all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.  Assumptions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are doing this evaluation, we can no longer change what we are, because we have already passed the formation years of our lives. What this analysis reveals, is what you are. Whether you like it or not, you'll have to live with it. There is no "right" or "wrong" driver. No driver is superior to others. Every driver is reasonable and legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of this evaluation is probably valid for approximately
    10-15 years, after which your priorities may change, depending on
    individual circumstance or life-changing events (like, winning a
    lottery or marrying up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The below drivers are collectively exhaustive and mutually
    exclusive, as you may have noticed in every other framework I've
    developed. In my opinion, a list is of little value unless it tries
    to be collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These drivers are at the most fundamental psychological level. For
    example, some people may say, I want to be creative. Being creative
    is not a fundamental driver. Why you want to be creative? Because
    you want to be recognized (R) as being a creative person, or you
    want to influence (I) people's lives in unique way, or you want to
    leave behind a legacy (L) that distinctively has your mark?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual dominance is excluded from this evaluation for the sake of
    analysis. Many social psychologists would probably argue that this
    particular driver overshadows everything else single-handedly, as
    the mission for any civilization ultimately is to reproduce itself,
    preserve the best genes and allocate limited resources to ensure the
    survival of the fittest. Let’s just leave that aside and for a
    second focus on something more platonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  Drivers: (SIMPLERK)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;tability &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stability is a desire to maintain a state of stability, avoid
unpredictable, reduce variability in life, seek for a kind of serenity
or tranquility. Some people are excited by a bustling life with constant
changes and new ventures, but some other people would prefer to have
greater control of his/her life and deal with things with well-defined
protocols/methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many careers are good venues for Stability, such as government jobs,
large corporate jobs, doctors, administrative/staff function jobs,
school jobs, etc. They are by no means easier, but usually are fairly
stable and you can figure out the rope quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;nfluence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influence is a desire to influence others’ behaviors and thoughts, to
change how people view or perceive certain things, to create a belief or
vision that people would follow, to make people do things they would not
do otherwise in the absence of absolute power, to will an action that
would not take place otherwise, to call to an action that people would
respond to. Influence is different from Power (which will be explained
later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influence can be found in many career choices, such as entrepreneurship
(change the world for a better place/make a dent in the universe),
designing (architecture, fashion, industrial design), religion founder
(Buddha , Christian Rosenkreuz), rebel (Gandhi, Che) bearer of hope
(Gandalf, Lawrence of the Arabia), teaching, writing, journalism, media,
activist, and Dr. Phil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;oney&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is a desire for … for lack of a better word, money. I understand
the mere appearance of this word in such a context will stir endless
debate and controversy, because people tend to believe that Money should
never be the end goal, rather it should be a means to the end, or a
derivative of the end. Most lecturers teaching startup/entrepreneurship
in B-schools would say you should never work for Money but your true
passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not my intention to get into any fruitless and pointless debate
about Money’s relationship to other more gloried goals/drivers in life. It is just pretty obvious that Money is a significant factor in making
career decisions. Some people care more, and some people care less, but
either way it is there. Why young people go to investment banking or
strategy consulting? Among other things that may be spiritually or
intellectually elevating, let’s face it - it’s Money. So Money has a
rightful place in my SIMPLERK framework. I have seen people whose
singular goal is to make as much money as they can, regardless of which
venture they choose. Having Money in the discussion makes the discussion
much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Careers that provide loads of money include investment banking, strategy
consulting, law firms, big-four accounting firms, medical doctors,
investment (highly dependent on how long you can stay in the game and
when do you leave the game), gangster, and pirate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;ower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power is a desire to make others bent to your will, by leveraging either
your social position or organizational position. It is much stronger
than Influence. Influence can be achieved forcefully or indirectly, in
an amicable manner, and Power is usually achieved in a much more
confrontational, direct manner. While both Influence and Power will lead
to altered behaviors of the recipients, Power has the additional benefit
of feeling unconstrained. Power as a desire probably has the greatest
impact to mankind’s history. Dynasties fall, nations rise, civilizations
sustain, all these can be attributed to some extraordinary individuals
who have insatiable appetite for power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Careers that lead to Power are government officials
(senators/congressmen, President, Speaker of the House, mayors,
ministers), founding fathers, military officers, big-corporate jobs,
movie directors, spies, super heroes (Batman, Spider Man, X-Men), any
senior job in a highly hierarchical organization where people pay more
attention to title/ranking than the person him/herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt;egacy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legacy is a desire to leave something behind to the world, to build
something that will stand on its own beyond our physical life, to create
something that can be carried forward generation after generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who desire for Legacy often donate money to build schools
(Stanford), build NPO foundations to tackle issues that no government or
corporate can handle (Gates Foundation), create art museums/galleries
that provide enlightenment (Getty, Guggenheim), write novels (Romance of
Three Kingdoms), develop real-estates, build bridges/dams, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;xperience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience is a desire to experience as many things/adventures in life
as possible, to carpe diem, to live one’s life to the fullest, to leave
no regret before leaving this world, to be able to claim “I’ve been there, done that”. A lot of people travel around the world, try out different jobs, make new girlfriends/boyfriends in each new country, always appreciate new thrills that come his/her way and never get tired of them. They seem to be drifters, moving from one thing to another, sometimes without apparent logical rationale. I find this desire much more common in the western cultures than in the eastern cultures (which are usually more utilitarian-driven).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs that provide rich experience (can be in terms of physical
environment, people interact with, or the contents itself) include
corporate auditors, corporate road warriors (who get rotated to a new
assignment every few years), certain government officials on rotation
assignment (elite squad or diplomat), missionary workers, event
management (wedding planner, travel agencies), restaurant critics,
sailors, bar owners/tenders, performance acts, groupies, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;ecognition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognition is a desire to be recognized by either peers/family members,
or people you know, or even people you don’t know. There are three
layers of recognition: 1) being appreciated as in possession of certain
skills; 2) being recognizable by having a personal brand that is
associated with certain positive image/perception; 3) being recognized
as better than many peers who are in the same business/profession, or as
simply the best, the most awesome one, the one. Recognition is in some
way connected to vanity, though vanity conveys much more negativity.
Recognition is also related to a strong desire to express one’s self.
(Though I think there might exist one category of special individuals
whose sole desire is just to express him/herself, regardless how that is
perceived/recognized by others. Gao Xingjian made that point in his
acceptance speech for 2000 Nobel Prize in Literature, echoing the voice
of George Orwell in his 1946 essay "Why I Write").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Careers that provide Recognition include sales, traders, investment
professionals (Buffett, Schwartzman), artists (Van Gogh, Pollock), poets
(Pink Floyd, Dylan), rock n’ roll stars (Led Zeppelin), writers
(Murakami), directors (Kubrick), movie stars/actors (Tom Cruise),
super-models (Adriana Lima), professional athletes (Jordan, Bryant,
Maradona), talk-show hosts (Fallon, O’Brien), and Kardashian sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K&lt;/strong&gt;nowledge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is a desire to explore the unknown world, to advance mankind’s
frontier of intellect and knowledge, to figure out the answer to the
ultimate question in the universe, to look for perfection and harmony
that usually bear no meaning to day-to-day life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with such desire and derive happiness from such accomplishment,
can be found in SETI scientists, researchers, professors, astronauts,
code-breakers, inventors (Tesla), theoretical mathematicians, string
theorists, and Stephen Wolfram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.  Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of SIMPLERK is very simple. After fully understanding the
    definition of the eight drivers, identify a few that resonate with
    you most. &lt;em&gt;Choose a career that does the best job in fulfilling all
    your identified drivers at the same time&lt;/em&gt;. Such a career may not be
    within reach to you right away and it might take a few stepping
    stones to get to it, but at least you know what it is. Sometimes
    such career may not even exist. Then you will need to invent it and
    find a platform that can carry it. The best jobs that the ones you
    create for yourself anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried SIMPLERK on many friends who are also on the quest
    looking for their meaning of life. The exercise has produced a
    surprisingly large variety in answers, which is pretty intriguing
    (to find out what my friends truly want and see that they all have
    different drivers) and at the same time demonstrates the robustness
    of this framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empirically most people identify 2 – 4 drivers from the above list
    of 8. It suffices to say if there is only one driver the person is not
    thinking wide open enough; if there are more than 4 drivers then the
    person has not quite figured out what he/she really wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that what drives us has a lot to do with our family
    background, the environment in which we’re brought up, and the way
    our parents educate us when we are young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is actually one more step to facilitate the finding of the
    drivers. In 2007 I quitted GE to work on a website full-time on my
    own to develop an ajax-based interactive tool. The tool provided
    much-needed scientific rigor into this framework and sort of helped
    testers figure out the drivers subconsciously (borrowing some ideas
    from Myers-Briggs Test). In late 2007 I went back to Beijing to join
    a VC-funded company as its CFO and discontinued the development of
    the website. Not sure where the codes are now, nor do I really care.
    I’ve found having beer in a noisy dive bar turns out to be quite
    effective, as well. The best part of SIMPLERK, and the most fun
    part, lies in its delivery, discussion and comparing notes. This
    writing cannot do its justice in that regard, but it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.  Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your reference, my main drivers, in descending order of
    significance, are: &lt;em&gt;Influence&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Recognition&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Money&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, I have been using this SIMPLERK framework as a compass
    to guide me through &lt;a href="../../../2013/03/an-entrepreneurs-manifesto-POOOUA-model/"&gt;every career
    transition&lt;/a&gt;,
    from a corporate career in GE to CFO in China, then to an
    entrepreneur in the Bay area after Stanford. It’s done a very
    effective and adequate job explaining my every move, and it also
    explains why I would not fancy a career in VC just yet. I’ll be
    happy to share some personal thoughts on this in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wanted to complete this article.  The end of my Sloan
    days feels like a right moment to synthesize everything. Hopefully
    my friends feel the same and find some value in SIMPLERK as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything written so far is just a prelude. The fun part of the
conversation only comes when we start applying &lt;strong&gt;SIMPLERK&lt;/strong&gt; on ourselves
and people around us, or figures we've heard about (say, Bill Gates or
Mayor Bloomberg). You know where to find me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="career"></category></entry><entry><title>A Day In A Sloan's Life</title><link href="http://guizishanren.com/posts/2013/04/a-day-in-a-sloans-life/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-28T12:36:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Herbert Yang</name></author><id>tag:guizishanren.com,2013-04-28:posts/2013/04/a-day-in-a-sloans-life/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have done a lot of presentations in my life, from participating in an

S353, I finally could not help but laying out my entire career
transitions, in the past, present, and future, on a diagram - something
I've been thinking about doing for a long time but never got the chance
to complete. This diagram is built on a framework I developed a while
ago &lt;a href="../../../2011/10/career-choice-consideration/"&gt;《Consideration in Career
Transition》&lt;/a&gt;,
which was written in Chinese and I haven't got the chance to translate
into English (if you know of any free secretary service, please let me
know. I can certainly use one or two.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, there are six dimensions for any career transition (obviously,
any list I have, is by definition collectively exhaustive and mutually
exclusive, otherwise what's the point of developing a
framework/theory?). They are, in descending order of importance:
sponsor, location, domain, company, function, and rank. In short, they
are "&lt;strong&gt;POOOUA&lt;/strong&gt;”. In different career stages we all try to move toward
our ideal career, but it usually takes multiple steps to complete the
transition along all six dimensions and rarely do we get to the dream
job at one go. Below diagram illustrates what kind of transition I
completed at each turn of my career. It almost reads like a manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;

differences between S353 (Entrepreneurship: Formation of New
Business)  and G566 (Real-Life
Ethics)&lt;/a&gt;,
two of my favorite GSB courses. Today's S353 class presented the last
case in this series of 18 very different and interesting startup
stories. So after all the discussions, what kind of lessons can we draw
from them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before George and Jim give us a summary on Thursday, I just want to
share my own takeaways. I call them "&lt;strong&gt;PPT&lt;/strong&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../../images/keytostartupsuccess.png", alt="key to Startup Success", width="800px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find these three qualities are not only exemplified throughout all the
18 S353 cases we have reviewed, but also demonstrated in all the startup
success stories that I personally know of, whether in US, Europe or
China. There are many other situational factors or circumstantial
strategies that were also instrumental to the success for those
founders, but in the grand scheme of all things those more "operational"
factors tend to wash out and become no more than a white noise in the
distribution of a seemingly random walk. What stand out in the end as
the true significant drivers and the common denominators of all, are
&lt;em&gt;Patience&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Perseverance&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tenacity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that Passion is not part of this by my account, which
might surprise some people. I think passion is definitely and obviously
a common attribute to many successful founders, and the value of passion
is that it brings tenacity. Many people have enough passion, but if that
cannot be translated into &lt;strong&gt;PPT&lt;/strong&gt;, the venture would still fail. On the
contrary, we've seen enough successful founders in S353 that don't
appear to have built their businesses with a particular passion for the
product/service/business model, but they got sufficient PPT to live
through the peaks and valleys and that's what gives their stories to an
eventual happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Career"></category></entry><entry><title>COASSF#49 - Chinese New Year Party</title><link href="http://guizishanren.com/posts/2013/03/chinese-new-year-party/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-11T11:32:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Herbert Yang</name></author><id>tag:guizishanren.com,2013-03-11:posts/2013/03/chinese-new-year-party/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On February 8, 2013, I emceed Sloan's Chinese New Year Party, which made
history by becoming the most attended self-organized Sloan event with
roughly 180 people (120 adults + 60 kids), in true Chinese fashion. We
squeezed out every inch in Havana Room but still could not find enough
chairs/tables for all the Sloans and the partners. The party followed a
format that was familiar to every Mainland Chinese - a gala filled with
delicious food, baijiu (Chinese white wine, very hard-core liquor) ,
stage performances, and variety shows. Not only it was a banquet of food
and drink, but also it was a total cultural immersion of three hours in
which I walked through five parts of some interesting elements of
Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part I - The Opening Teaser&lt;/em&gt; (you are supposed to be scared)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/17109638?rel=0" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part II - Story of Chinese Food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part III - Story of Chinese New Year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Party IV - Story of Year of Snake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part V - Story of Chinese Characters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom:5px"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you know you are on a Chinese New Year party when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're drowned in an ocean of people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food keeps flowing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are getting high on baijiu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dumplings are delicious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very noisy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extremely chaotic all around - always something breaking somewhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people dressed in red&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous on-stage shows and performances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some MC is speaking tirelessly on stage, while most people tune in
    half-heartedly and focus on eating dumplings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party ends with a heartwarming song (either Unforgettable
    Tonight, or The Moon Speaks For My Heart)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

After leading Nicki's "Hall of Shame" for many weeks in a row, I decided to redeem  myself in front of Nicki and get it over with. For someone with a petty education background prior to Stanford, I actually don't think I've ever written a yearbook message before. So I did a bit of research to see what this whole yearbook message thing is about in US, and I've arrived at the following takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing the yearbook message could be quite an effort, especially if&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you want to stand out and leave something others can remember you by&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the message should be original, creative, witty, and memorable, to say the least; being inspirational or cruel will be a plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use quotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending a few hours to dig out some old emails and blogs, I came up with my yearbook message, finally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At first, I was afraid, I was petrified. Kept thinking, I could never do this well with all of you shining by my side. But then I spent so many minutes thinking, how I came here. And I grew strong and I learned how to introduce myself." - &lt;em&gt;first meeting&lt;/em&gt;, July 1, 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I engage, I entertain, I enthrall” – &lt;em&gt;CMC Linkedin workshop&lt;/em&gt;, Aug 10, 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Study Hard, Social Harder" - &lt;em&gt;Class Meeting&lt;/em&gt;, Aug 22, 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm S-ettling down in CA + S-tarting a new business + S-eeking friends &amp;amp; partners" - &lt;em&gt;BBL&lt;/em&gt;, Oct 1, 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At times of uncertainties or Act of God, do not panic, do not question, do not hesitate, just follow my command" - &lt;em&gt;Gangnam Style flash mob&lt;/em&gt;, Oct 12, 2012&lt;/p&gt;

graduation. All good things will come to an end, and our wonderful
journey at Sloan Fellow Program in Stanford GSB is of no exception. The
question is: how can we make the most out of this 12-month period?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the Fall Quarter from October to December is the "sweet spot"
that we should take the most advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../../images/Sloan-Life-Cycle.png", width="800px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to forming relationship and bonding with our fellow
Sloans, there are two dominant factors that will influence how much we
can put in and how much we can get out. One is &lt;em&gt;time available for
socializing&lt;/em&gt; with the classmates, and the other one is our &lt;em&gt;desire to bond&lt;/em&gt;
with others in the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By my observation and analysis, our desire to bond with other Sloans
roughly follows a curve (red one in the diagram) where: 1) overall it's
always increasing (of course); 2) it's accelerating in the first half
and decelerating in the second half. That convection point occurs
somewhere in Fall Quarter or Winter Quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Summer Quarter&lt;/em&gt;, we take all the classes together and we're the only
one on campus (MBAs are out doing internships). So the classic grouping
dynamic plays out - we're curious to find out everyone's background and
try to stack ourselves against the group to find out where we stand.
This is the period where personal reputation is built from the classroom
discussions and group projects. On average a Sloan may not be able to
call out everyone else's name yet in the class, but we're getting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Fall Quarter&lt;/em&gt;, the accumulative social activities have gradually been
adding up to a critical mass to enable most Sloans to remember everyone
else's name in the class. The most aggressive alpha males (or females)
have already identified themselves and stepped up to take some class
officer roles to serve the class and make their presence felt. Sloans
still take most of the classes together. A variety of personality types
are flashing out and bumping with each other. We still take study groups
pretty seriously and try to get decent scores. The MBAs have arrived in
Knight Management Center but they are preoccupied with orientation and
neither camp has the bandwidth to reach out to the other side yet.
Dinners with Sloans are still possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Winter Quarter&lt;/em&gt;, things are getting really hectic as
academic curriculum is taking a hefty toll and the daunting prospect of
finding that dream job is looming on the horizon. Sloans on average are
in 3 - 4 study groups working on different projects. Most people seem to
be taking around 20 units. Two streams of classes are killing people
left and right: 1) hard-core investment/finance classes; 2) startup
classes. We are only taking Marketing and Finance together and it feels
like we never get to see certain classmates in this quarter. This is
also when we start taking many classes with MBAs. Stanford MBAs are
pretty solid and sometimes more fun. Some Sloans start hanging out with
MBAs and spending even less time with each other. At the same time, many
Sloans begin their job search and cut down the time in holding hands
with other Sloans singing jambalaya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we stand now. Looking forward at &lt;em&gt;Spring Quarter&lt;/em&gt;, I can see
Sloans will be struggling to strike a balance between two competing
forces: 1) the singular goal of finding a job and stay in the Bay area;
2) the desire to solidify friendship and spend more time with Sloans as
every day that goes by reminds us that the clock is ticking and we're
walking out of a beautiful fantasy dreamland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the desire for bonding, time available for social activities is
another important factor that will shape the group dynamics. Summer
Quarter looks like a walk in the park now - we even had regular weekly
basketball games! It's hard to believe we had so much free time then! It
certainly didn't feel that way when we were in it - maybe because we
were still taking the courses pretty seriously and reading every case
assigned. Fall Quarter's Accounting class alone will usher many people
into recurring nightmares and reduce their social drive, but it is still
not too bad as we still have a sizable group that goes to Wednesday's
ETL regularly. In Winter Quarter people start disappearing all together,
or simply just go different ways into various BBLs, seminars,
conferences, across-the-street classes, endless market-research
interviews for startup projects, etc. People are worrying less about the
qualify of academic work and just want to finish the work and move on.
People are exploring Stanford/Bay area at large and paying much less
attention to Knight Management Center. Very few people can afford to
attend the ETL series. Dinner time with Sloans becomes a luxury. In
Spring Quarter, the key focus for the self-sponsored Sloans will be job
search and job search. We might see a slight rebound in time put aside
for social activities, but I doubt it's going to be anything
substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, given all the forces in the universe that are pushing us into
various directions, it seems that Fall Quarter is the "&lt;em&gt;sweet spot&lt;/em&gt;" where
Sloans still have considerable desire to social and are able to afford
the time. Carpe diem!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term=""></category></entry><entry><title>COASSF#46 - Comparison of S353 (Formation of New Venture) and G566 (Real-Life Ethics)</title><link href="http://guizishanren.com/posts/2013/02/comparison-S353-and-G566-in-GSB/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-28T15:20:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Herbert Yang</name></author><id>tag:guizishanren.com,2013-02-28:posts/2013/02/comparison-S353-and-G566-in-GSB/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;G566 Real-Life Ethics was my &lt;a href="../../../2013/01/fall-qtr-course-evaluation/"&gt;most favorite class in the Fall

share a lot of similarities, but resonate with me at very different
levels. Here's a detailed breakdown of comparison between them:&lt;/p&gt;

mentioned, doing one of those startup-themed courses (E245, S321) feels
almost like a rite of passage for many Stanford MBA/Sloans. So, should
you just go and do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It depends. Here's the decision tree I'd recommend. If you need more
insight, contact me in private. I don't pass isolated judgement on any
GSB course in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Stanford GSB Sloan Fellow Chinese New Year Party on this Friday,
Feb 08，2013. The songs are picked for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their festive and party spirit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their iconic （many of them legendary） status in the Chinese music industry;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their ability to represent certain distinctive genres of Chinese music;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their coverage of the key Chinese regions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan,
    Southeast Asia, and Mainland. The audience for this party consists
    of 80 Sloan Fellows with their partners/children that come from 30+
    countries all over the world with age ranging from 30 - 45
    （roughly）.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it represent my taste? Of course not, but it's a great list for a
party like Chinese New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

year, I find myself spending at least 2-3 hours every day this week in a
perpetual (often futile ) attempt to optimize my courses for this
quarter. The exhaustive and reiterative process has been very tiring,
but much needed. Because the course selection of Winter Quarter is
critical, unique and sets the course for half of my Sloan year. In
Summer and Fall Quarter, our curriculum was largely the same with
limited variations - there was not much we can do to adjust the
curriculum. Things start getting interesting in Winter Quarter, when we
only have two classes together (Finance and Marketing) and need to fill
up more than 50% of our academic calendar with self-selected coures from
GSB and other school. The below 15 factors, in descending order of
importance, might be helpful in strategizing your most optimal course
portfolio, from the perspective of a GSB Sloan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iconic Courses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the signature courses that have achieved immortal status in
Stanford lore. Most Stanford alumni have taken them or at least
auditioned them just so that they can proudly claim they have been to
Stanford. Even non-Stanford people from around the world follow those
courses religiously online from many open-course platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://etl.stanford.edu/"&gt;MS&amp;amp;E 472: Entrepreneurial Thought Leader's Seminar
("ETL")&lt;/a&gt;  You should make it a ritual to
attend this star-stubbed seminar at 430pm on every Wednesday. This is
the one seminar that rules them all, that bonds all Stanford students
from all the disciplines together. You can also easily get one credit if
you care to. Enrollment is easy as long as you have no scheduling
conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/"&gt;CS 106A: Programming
Methodology&lt;/a&gt;. Legend has it that
90% of Stanford students have taken this introductory programming
course, which does not require any prior programming experience. We're
in Silicon Valley and Stanford. It just feels wrong not to take this
course to at least understand how coders work and think. Anyone with any
significance in Silicon Valley is most likely linked to Stanford in some
way, and most people have taken CS106A. So you're truly in the company
of some future movers and shakers of our time. While enrolling into this
course for credit with the undergraduates 3 times a week is probably a
bit of a stretch, you can always audition it or watch the online video.
Enrollment is easy as it's a huge lecture class with a roaster of a few
hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

Capital&lt;/a&gt;.
The most sought-after Stanford GSB course, and the most difficult one to
get into. People weep in tears upon the news of enrollment. Valley
extraordinaires Peter Wendell, Andy Rachleff, and Eric Schmidt co-teach
this class. They have enormous pull from Sand Hill Road and Silicon
Valley, and thus regularly invite first-class entrepreneurs and VCs to
the classroom to share their insights. Wendell brought in &lt;a href="http://www.khoslaventures.com/people_vk.html"&gt;Vinod
Khosla&lt;/a&gt; in the first class
of the quarter last week, as if just to make a statement. You have to
super-round this one to have the chance to get in as every GSBer is
throwing his/her super-round option on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

and Entrepreneurial Finance&lt;/a&gt;.
The legendary 7-unit course taught by celebrated value investor Jack
McDonald (to give an idea, most courses are 2-3 units; 4 units is
considered pretty heavy; 5 units is very rare; 7 units is out of this
world). If you're going to do investment of any kind, you should try to
enroll into this class. Auditioning attempt will be futile. McDonald has
a photographic memory even at his current age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;.
The famous "touchy feely" course in GSB that everyone is talking about.
All my Sloan classmates who are taking this course are raving about it
and many GSBers think this is the single best course in all their GSB
years. As someone who has watched David Finch's Fight Club (1999) many
times, the mere thought of "touch feely” brings up vivid pictures of a
support group therapy session, where everyone is crying over the
shoulders of someone else, and occasionally Edward Norton buries his
head in Meat Loaf's man-boobs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Celebrity Professors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many illuminaries, Sillicon legends, Nobel laureates, and billionnaires
walked the corridors of Knight Management Center. There are so many of
them in this pantheon of gods that it'll be almost an insult to them to
single-out any individual ones. There are some larger-than-life
personalities whose mere presence will enthrall people in awe such
as: &lt;a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/jmcdonal"&gt;Jack McDonald&lt;/a&gt; (GSB's
franchise professor), &lt;a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/agrove"&gt;Andrew
Grove&lt;/a&gt; (Intel),
and &lt;a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/condi"&gt;Condoleezza
Rice&lt;/a&gt; (Secretary of State);
there are some glittering entrepreneurs/VCs whose names have been heard
by every GSBer such as &lt;a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/pwendell"&gt;Peter
Wendell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://engineering.stanford.edu/profile/sblank"&gt;Steve
Blank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/rachleff"&gt;Andy
Rachleff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/mleslie1"&gt;Mark
Leslie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/author/heidi_roizen"&gt;Heidi
Roizen&lt;/a&gt;; there are many
Nobel winners in GSB, such as &lt;a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/mscholes"&gt;Myron
Scholes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/mspence"&gt;A. Michael
Spence&lt;/a&gt;; there are also
some filthily rich professor billionaire such as  &lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~cheriton/"&gt;David
Cheriton&lt;/a&gt; (who famously wrote
Google's first check). There are many, many more. You're in Stanford.
Nobody gets to teach here by being less than a superstar in his/her own
right. Even for the professors who classes we don't quite enjoy, I can
see why they can stand here on a solid ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Juicy Startup Courses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://startup.gsb.stanford.edu/"&gt;S356: Startup Garage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/msande273/"&gt;M273: Technology Venture
Formation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://e245.stanford.edu/"&gt;E245: The Lean Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&amp;amp;filter-coursestatus-Active=on&amp;amp;page=0&amp;amp;catalog=&amp;amp;q=STRAMGT+321%3A+Create+a+New+Venture%3A+From+Idea+to+Launch+I&amp;amp;collapse="&gt;S321: Create a New Venture, From Idea to
Launch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many think it's a rite of passage to do a startup-themed course in
Stanford - which is probably true, especially for those who haven't done
startup before. The above four are your choices, among which two are
from School of Engineering. Choose them carefully because it's a
significant undertaking. You should expect to spend 15-30 hours a week,
which include class time, many hours of team meetings, and regular
review sessions with assigned mentors. All of them require application
as a team. S356 and S321 are heavy two-quarter commitments (you can
still get out after one quarter but it might create bad will with your
team), while M273 and E245 are one-quarter only. I will try to do a more
in-depth analysis and comparison among these courses in a separate
article. Make sure you choose the right team  (3-4) for these coures
because you'll spend significant hours together, much more than a
typical study group format requires. Grouping with the wrong person for
3 months is much worse than sitting in the wrong class. You sort of
place a big bet of your social capital (ie. time) on 3 people
(Sloan/MBA/engineer) at the expense of the other 70-80 Sloans. Good
luck. Another great benefit of these courses is the mentor the
instructor will assign to you, and the opportunity to pitch to real VCs
for your project. For people who are new to this process, this will be a
great experience to get hands dirty and get a taste of how it's like
working in startups and with VCs. For people who have gone through this
process before, don't get too dizzy with all the shining names from Sand
Hill. It takes several reciprocal transactions to start building a real
business relationship. MBAs have more means at their disposal such as
independent studies, case-writing, teaching assistant etc. As Sloans,
we're in general a bit handicapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reasonable Course Portfolio Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's helpful to have a rough roadmap before coming to Stanford Sloan in
terms of what you want to get out of it, then allocate your courses (or,
your tuition) strategically. I suggest strategizing your portfolio of
courses around the below major categories: A) Startup track; B)
Corporate Track; C) Investment Track; D) Social Innovation ; E)
International Politics &amp;amp; Economies;  F) Leadership. G) Communication
(this is for Sloans only. Few Sloans would go Consulting after
graduation). It's advisable to major in only one stream from A to E,
maybe minor in another stream from F to G, then taste the rest with a
surveyor mentality. &lt;em&gt;Do not major in two streams&lt;/em&gt;. It will kill your
social calendar and cost you the most valuable asset you can get out of
Sloan program - bonding with other Sloans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is self-explanatory - you do whatever you want to do in the
wilderness, do 1-2 above mentioned startup course; sign up for every
course that has "entrepreneurship" in its title from every school;
attend weekly ETL religiously; hack your way into Wendell's class; watch
every video from &lt;a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/"&gt;Stanford's e-Corner&lt;/a&gt;;
attend as many Silicon Valley TMT conferences as your budget allows;
enroll into CS106A just to show you're hard-core; and make some young
friends in School of Computer Science or Engineering who only enjoy
coding for the pure pleasure of coding regardless of how lousy the
actual product/service is - which inevitably is designed by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; is for people with corporate sponsorship or willing to go back to the
corporate environment. Sign up for some bad-ass named courses such as
&lt;a href="http://csi.gsb.stanford.edu/the-paths-to-power"&gt;Paths to Power&lt;/a&gt;,
Decision for the Future, etc. Minoring in either leadership or
communication goes well with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; has three sub-streams: angel/VC investment, private equity investment,
and public investment (hedge fund and portfolio management). They all
lead to very different industry dynamics, practices, and locations so
you want to think carefully before stepping into any stream. Get into
the class of Jack McDonald, Peter Wendell, and Charles Lee. Run for
Sloan Class' Investment Committee officer position. Show up at every
event whenever any member of Stanford Management Company (Stanford's
endowment fund) is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D is D. E is a common choice for Sloans sponsored by governments or
coming from family business background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flashy One-Timers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to take note of some highly desired courses that are only
offered in a particular quarter (due to the availability of the
instructor, who might be attending multiple board meetings or making
movies, or advising US President in the other three quarters). For
example, Jack McDonald's legendary 7-unit course on investment and
entrepreneur finance (Fall Quarter), Leadership in Entertainment
Business (Spring Quarter), and Real-Life Ethics (Fall Quarter). Take
them before they vanish from your academic year's calendar, which is
only one-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heavy Two-Quarter Commitments&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many courses run across two continuous quarters because they use team
projects as the teaching vehicle. Make sure you sign up for the first
leg at the right quarter, otherwise it'll be very difficult to join them
at the second leg. That being said, there are still ways to join the
second leg of some of those courses. For example, when some people drop
from a team after the first leg, a position may become available and the
instructor may want to fill that with someone new just to keep the
group/project/class going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confusing Application-Required Courses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MyGSB and Axess are the main portals to register for our courses, but
not always. Some courses require application and may not even been
available to register from Axess. There are three types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration available on Axess + No application needed. This is easy. Just register on Axess and you're set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration available on Axess + Application needed. Very confusing. You have registered the course on Axess, but you still
have to go through a separate application process outside of Axess to
get enrolled, which means your precious calendar will be taken up by a
course that is not guaranteed to you yet and at the same time might get
in your way for other courses. The Spirit of Entrepreneurship and Lean
Launchpad come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration not available on Axess + Application needed Less confusing but more mysterious. They are not on Axess, you have to
go to their own idiosyncratic websites to apply or even go through the
draconian means of ... email. Sloan's staff does a pretty good job on
this and will organize talks before the registration period to highlight
all such courses that need special attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evil Exams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps to go for the electives that have no exams - so that you will
be free in the last exam-week and start your vacation earlier while
others are still sweating on exams. It seems that most electives do not
have exams, but some of them do have, such as Decision for the Future.
Be aware and stay away from those courses, unless you really love them
dearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shining Guest Speakers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you evaluate the attractiveness of a course, the quantity and the
quality of its guest speakers are very important. They can make a huge
difference and bring life to an otherwise dreadful classroom session.
They also reflect how influential the professor is and how much pull
he/she's got in the industry and around the Silicon Valley. For many
classes guest speakers are integral part of the teaching, such as Real
Estate Investment, Real-Life Ethics, Entrepreneurship: Formation of New
Ventures, The Spirit of Entrepreneurship, Election 2012, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bright MBAs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the core courses are Sloan-only. Some electives are set up to be
Sloan-only (such as Executive Communications). Most electives have mix
of MBAs and Sloans. Personally it's been an enlightening experience for
me to take many clases with MBAs, who are smart, respectful and mature
(despite of their much younger average age).  I wish I could have spent
more time with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geeky Coders and Engineers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attend some classes "across the street" from School of Engineering or
School of Computer Science. Stanford GSB students can rival the best
MBAs from any school, including Harvard and Wharton, but still they are
not the prince of the universe here. Don't lose the sight of the fact
that Silicon Valley's culture, wealth, and social pecking order are
defined and ruled by engineers and coders from Stanford. It will pay
long-term dividend to make some friends there and at least understand
how they work and think. Besides attending ETL and CS106A, go to some
seminars/talks organized by Engineering and Computer Science. Don't get
too caught up in Knight Management Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personalized Seasonality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With many Sloans regularly taking around 20 credits a quarter, it's
fairly easy to satisfy the academic requirements for graduation, which
ask for 56 credits, out of which at least 50 come from GSB. Summer
Quarter is pretty light with only 12 credits (we played many basketball
games then - utterly unthinkable now);  Fall Quarter and Winter Quarter
are the heaviest. You do have some level of discretion about Spring
Quarter. You can either load yourself up to attend as many classes as
you can to make good on your \$108,000 tuition investment, or go by with
only 11 credits - the lowest credits you have to maintain to qualify as
a full-time student.  You can free up yourself to pursue other things in
life, such as landing a job, finding a significant other, starting a
business, or making some babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manageable Team Relationships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every class requires some sort of grouping. So we always end up
in 4-6 different groups in Fall/Winter/Spring Quarter. Most of them are
only called for on as-needed basis when group project deliverables are
approaching. However, be aware that some groups are quite heavy-lifting
and require significant investment in time and emotion (like "Touchy
Feely") due to the nature of the group projects. All the startup-themed
classes, as well as the assigned study group for Finance and Marketing,
fall into this category. Depending what kind of people you end up with
in your groups, some groups choose to meet as little as possible and
some groups prefer to do everything together. Welcome to B-school, where
drama never ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgotten Audition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not forget to audit. Many a time you're not able to enroll into a
particular class for reasons such as, you max out your 22 credits for
the quarter, the class is full, it conflicts with other classes on your
calendar, etc. You can still sit in for those classes as long as the
instructor permits. You sit in the back row; do not raise your hand; no
participation, no homework, no grade; you're just a spectator - this is
auditing. I would always audit for Wendell's class as long as I'm not
completely burned out. With so many intellectually stimulating classes
opening their doors to you left and right, it'll be a crime and waste of
your tuition money if you don't do any auditing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precious Wednesday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last and the least, try to keep your Wednesday free of any class except
ETL, which is always on Wednesday afternoon. Sloan staff usually
schedules program-related activities on Wednesday, such as important
announcements or class meetings. Many study groups schedule their weekly
session on Wednesday.  You should also leave some room for yourself for
interviews, out-of-town trips. An inconveniently timed class on
Wednesday might screw up all such schedules and make you very unpopular
in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voila!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term=""></category></entry><entry><title>COASSF#41 - Why Search Funds Might Make Sense</title><link href="http://guizishanren.com/posts/2013/01/why-search-funds-make-sense/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-24T16:07:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Herbert Yang</name></author><id>tag:guizishanren.com,2013-01-24:posts/2013/01/why-search-funds-make-sense/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some Stanford lecturers and alumni are involved in the business of
search fund, but this is one type of investment vehicle that is often
not well understood by people from outside. The model makes sense to the
three parties involved in the following ways ... I think:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the searchers&lt;/em&gt; (MBAs in pair, who go raising capital to fund the
search, identify an acquisition target company, raise more capital to
buy it, run it for several years, and sell it for profit at the right
EBIDTA),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This model is almost exclusively for MBAs (mostly young) with little
    to no operating/management experience but have some entrepreneurial
    spirit to be a change agent and live their lives on their own terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It fits with newly minted MBAs' desire of running businesses,
    improving operation and managing processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many MBAs (especially those with consulting or banking background)
    have no particular desire for product creation/development, nor
    strong passion for any particular domains, but want to run a
    business by applying business school tactics and skills. Search
    fund's model suits such desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It provides to the searchers the opportunity to become CEO of a
    small to medium-sized company (right away after the search is
    completed and the deal is closed), which is not available to most
    MBA graduates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The searchers have the luxury of learning the business at reasonable
    pace and groom themselves into effective CEOs because search fund
    targets are usually cash flow positive business with stable business
    models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The searchers don't have to deal with the nuances faced by the CEO
    of a typical startup, like handling all the back room matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a possibility that it could be relatively easy to turn
    around a small-sized traditional type of business that doesn't
    typically embrace modern management practice such as regular team
    meetings or neat financial analysis from Excel. There might be many
    low-hanging fruits there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the investors&lt;/em&gt; (individuals who give capital to the searchers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower risk (lower return as well) because the target companies
    already have EBIDTA and a stable operating structure and
    environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower entry of investment compared to VC and PE funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrarian play because most of the target companies are in
    traditional, less sexy industries (but with potential to unlock
    value from simple process improvement) that are often overlooked by
    the VC/PE firms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower risk from more flexibility in capital commitment due to the
    two-staged funding process and the usual right-of-the-first-refusal
    clause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to get much more involvement and utilize his/her own domain
    expertise, unlike being a LP in a typical VC/PE fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better access to the invested target companies because GP =
    Management team, which provides a higher level of comfort and lowers
    the perceived risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the sellers&lt;/em&gt; (current owners of the target company who sell the
company to the search fund)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search funds might be the only buyers available as their companies
    are usually fairly small, under the radar screen of the big VC/PE
    firms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suits the needs for the owners/founders who want to retire but want
    to make sure the business is in good hands as search fund GPs are
    much more committed than typical VC professionals, who are pure
    financial investors.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical equity split after 1st round in the Valley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;                          &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Options&lt;/span&gt;                     &lt;span class="mi"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Founders&lt;/span&gt;                    &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Total&lt;/span&gt;                       &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the VC numbers are shockingly high to me. In China I've
    never seen any startup after 1st round with such an equity split
    that favors VCs so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical equity split among founding team after 1st round in the Valley
on average:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;                         &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;VP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Engineering&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;VP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Marketing&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;VP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sale&lt;/span&gt;                  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Controller&lt;/span&gt;                  &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Engineer&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Engineer&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Director&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Marketing&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Manager&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael asked a question about CFO. Lecturer's answer was straight:
    don't include CFO in your founding team, unless it's a hard-core
    financing business. Well, that's some encouraging news there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not recruit close friends into your startup, especially the best-man
on your wedding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vest the stocks for new members you invite to join the founding team. Do
not vest your own stocks (obviously).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not give part-timers more than 1.0% stock. Do not partner with
someone that can only work part-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the free interns from business schools. Make them hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use convertible bond (CB) for fund-raising. It's more effective and
efficient than the traditional equity fund-raising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill out Schedule C  (roles, responsibilities, deliverables, and
timeline) of LLC's legal document in details to minimize founder's
risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why some founders appear to be very generous with distributing their
stocks? - because when the company is small, they feel they have little
to lose, so they don't really care. When the company gets bigger and its
valuation gets higher, founder's mentality will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Case SHED:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 is the best number for the size of a startup team (even Google's
    Brin and Page had to bring Schmidt to balance out). 4 is usually not
    very stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not split equity equally. It rarely works out. In the case of 3
    founders, make sure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a single largest shareholder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equity stake of any two founders is greater than the third
    one's&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not discuss equity split until there is a tangible idea to work
    on and everyone knows what his/her role is. Discussion on equity
    split, once occurred, is very difficult to roll back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not form a partnership only based on common interests, or purely
    based on friendship. Every condition below has to be met before
    forming a startup partnership:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;same value system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;common interest areas (entertainment, mobile Internet,
    healthcare, agriculture... something)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a business idea that all parties agree to commit to (could be a
    vague one.. but there has to be one)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;complementary skill set&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vetting on team members during GSB days is essential, but may not be
    sufficient. A man's true character and personality are only revealed
    when there is significant money at stake. TGIFs, study group
    discussions, coffee breaks at Coupa, study trips, all these
    interactions certainly help to understand someone's value system and
    integrity, but founders should not get too carried away on those
    findings. When there is no real money at play, it's not hard to get
    along with most people in GSB. GSB's environment, compared to
    real-life startup situations, is not stressful enough to put a man
    in a corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of defensible and sustainable business model is
    over-rated (Monitor Group did go bankrupt). A startup play is to
    arbitrage on the constraint optimization. When other players in the
    market see the same potential, that arbitrage opportunity will
    diminish unless the company reinvents itself. Everything is in
    relative sense - a startup is only as successful as the founders are
    able to exit with respectable return before it's lost its edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attending trade shows to get business ideas? This might work in the
    case of SHED, but I won't use that as the main source of idea
    generation. My problem, and my partners' problem, has always been
    that we have way too many ideas we want to work on, and we only have
    limited resources. I've never been in a situation like, oh my god, I
    have no idea what to start up with. Let me go attend a trade show to
    get some ideas. I get hit by ideas all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do founders know an idea is new? In our case, it's very simple.
    All three of us are very well informed and plugged in our own
    networks. If an idea pops up and none of us has heard about it
    before, almost by definition it has to be a new idea (otherwise we
    would have known).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of SHED case brings out a very interesting business
    strategy that is pretty rare but could be highly effective.
    Occasionally, a small player can leverage existing competition and
    play off against big players. For details, read Isaac Asimov's
    Foundation series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a new business without domain expertise is very possible,
    as Sarah Blakely of Spanx, Tory Burch of Tory Burch, and Scott and
    Eric from SHED have demonstrated. With enough passion and
    dedication, it's not that hard to catch up on the knowledge and
    experience. It's not easy, but can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

from the summer and the fall quarter, or I should keep any individual
textbook. After pondering for 0.01 second, I decided to sell them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three ways to sell those used textbooks for cash: A) sell to
Stanford Bookstore for cash right away; B) trade in on Amazon.com for
Amazon gift card; C) Follow what I just did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sell to Stanford Bookstore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/BuybackMaterialsView?catalogId=10001&amp;amp;schoolStoreId=10161"&gt;search the ISBN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bring the books to Stanford Bookstore and get cash on the spot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trade in on Amazon.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;search the ISBN at this
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trade-In/b/ref=sv_b_0?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=2242532011"&gt;Amazon's Trade-in Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;follow the website's instructions, print out the
shipping label, and ship out the books by the required date&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;receive an Amazon gift card&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arbitrage between Stanford Bookstore and Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford Bookstore offers cash right away, but mostly at discounted
prices. For some books Amazon offers substantially higher prices (such
as Microeconomics and Financial Accounting), but you get an Amazon gift
card instead of cash, and Amazon may impose more strict conditions on
the books. You just have to strike a balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here's my trades:&lt;/p&gt;

framework I developed in the summer. It's a somewhat scientific approach
to validate my favorite courses: Real-life Ethics, Election 2012,
Political Communication, Organization Behavior, and Generative
Leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final group presentation in Executive Communication was critiqued by
several judges of local Sloan alumni. We had a pleasant chat with one of
the judges after the team presentation, a young Sloan alumni with curly
hair, who gave us some thoughtful feedback. After getting through the
business stuff our conversation went casual and off the path. Seemingly
randomly he asked who had taken Real-Life Ethics. I identified myself
and went on a lengthy and passionate speech of flowery praise about how
much I enjoyed that class thoroughly and loved the instructor Mark
Leslie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of my speech, he smiled at me, I'm glad to hear that, Mark is
my father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.....o....k.&lt;/p&gt;

Spillovers&lt;/em&gt;, debuted with a four-song set list at the end-of-quarter
Dinner &amp;amp; Dance party for the Sloan class. After 14 days of intense
rehearsals during the nerve-breaking final-exam weeks, we had a blast
and shredded the night away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our drummers John is a local here. Right at the beginning of our
academic year, he proposed on our Facebook Group page that we should
form a rock band. Not surprisingly, no much response was received at
that time as Sloans were all busy figuring out where to get lockers and
mattress, that sort of thing, pretty low on the whole
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. It took one flash mob (of Gangnam Style)
and one NCAA half-time performance (Gangnam Style, again) for the Sloan
Class of 2013 to proudly announce its arrival in the Hall of Fame
and demonstrate to Graduate School of Business and Stanford University
that there is no mountain that cannot be conquered by this class of
unprecedented enormous talent. So when Tracee, our co-social chair for
the Autumn Quarter, commissioned for a band performance at this
Sloans-Gone-Wild Dinner &amp;amp; Dance party, this monumental task naturally
fell upon the shoulders of a few choice individuals who got bored with
final exams (maybe just academic study in general, especially
Accounting) and have developed a habit of making history for Sloans, for
GSB, and for Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band was taking shape quickly. I knew Yuki and Jun both played
guitar and could sing very well, from our crazy karaoke parties in Music
Tunnel in Sunny Vale; I knew Ryan and I were in the same school of rock
through Facebook chat even before we met in Stanford; I knew Colin
always had the aspiration to be a rock singer at the house party of
California Ave; Cherie and I shared the same passion for rock music
festival; I knew Tracee would be game for anything; everybody saw how
good a drummer Alex was on our Deepavali party and I knew Su could play
keyboard by.... whatever.. I just did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a venue to practice and all the music instruments/amps usually
would be a huge challenge to any new band. Luckily we had John The
Resourceful, who graciously offered his big house nearby the campus for
our jam sessions; and we had Ryan The Passion, who went on a buying
spree for a guitar (Paul Reed Smith no less!) , a bass, and three
amplifiers. I managed to borrow two microphones from a local friend.
Tracee helped us set up the on-site logistics for the party night and we
were all set to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between Nov 29 and Dec 12, we had five jam sessions. It was a ton of
fun, sometimes because John's adorable in-house girls rock band warmed
the stage for us, sometimes because we were all in awe by
Colin's quintessential power rocker pose, or sometimes because Yuki's
impromptu guita riff brought us back to the good old days of Pink Floyd
and Led Zeppelin, before JB of the kind took over the world. John always
served us good pizza, beer and wine. LSD would be the only missing piece
to make this a perfect party to get high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our band members have played in some sort of rock band before,
like twenty years ago in high school. Some of us did that in secrecy
without the knowledge of our wives - which became a moment of great
revelation during the debut performance that would forever live as one
of the urban legends of this class. When I lived in Beijing between 2008
- 2012, I hanged out with a group of friends who were all &lt;a href="http://site.douban.com/peixi/"&gt;phenomenal
singers&lt;/a&gt;. Often we jammed at some
bars/clubs with the in-house band when they finished their set for the
night and the crowd has left. We always had a dream of forming a band of
our own, but quickly we realized there would be too many vocals and the
band would be missing players for guitar, bass, drum, trumpet, or
keyboard. Basically, as far as forming a band went, we were all useless.
Who would have thought, I would live my dream in Stanford, in a bona
fide rock band? It felt good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The band name The Spillovers came from our depleted brains when
preparing for the final exam of Global Strategies - it's one of those
strategy lingoes that no one except Professor John Roberts really
understands what it actually means. Loosely, it's about synergy that
spills over from one to another. We had a lot of fun jamming together at
John's house and positive energy was flowing in the air - so the name
naturally stuck with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night of our debut finally arrived. The Dinner &amp;amp; Dance party was a
black-tie event, which constrained to some extend how outlandish we
could dress the part for the band performance. We didn't go as far as
wearing latex rocker pants (we had that), but we pulled the best effort
we could under the circumstance. Colin and I changed into tight T-shirt
and wore a bandana; John and Alex wore a pirate wig; Yuki played up
Brit-Pop flare; Jun got his party outfit on; Tracee got the Dylan hat
on; Cherie and Su looked gorgeous and sexy. The best-dressed honor went
to none other than Ryan, who put up ultra-heavy make-up and became
utterly unrecognizable in true spirit of KISS' Gene Simmons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and the rest, is history.&lt;/p&gt;

of Stanford in the coming Winter Quarter. As most other design-themed
courses from Stanford's trendy Design School, it has a
somewhat idiosyncratic application, in which I need to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Share a single url that describes how your past experience has prepared
you to contribute to the dmedia class- a portfolio, a pdf, a flickr
page, a twitter feed, a video, an example of your work online-preferably
something we haven't thought of... it's up to you. Please make sure your
name &amp;amp; a title / description on the url is visible so we know it's you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've laid out my answer in this page - why I think I can make a
meaningful contribution to the dmedia class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm familiar with developing mobile applications on
    smartphones.&lt;/em&gt; I've co-founded a startup that develops mobile
    applications (iOS &amp;amp; Android) leveraging the largest social network
    in China.Our app &lt;a href="http://www.zheli.com"&gt;zheli&lt;/a&gt;.com once made it into
    Top 10 in the Local Life Category in Apps Store
    China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../../images/zheli.com.png", width="800px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have always been a visionary and evangelist&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to
    the smartphone revolution. I drew this chart in 2007, right after
    buying my first iPhone (Generation 1), and &lt;a href="http://guizishanren.com/apples-entire-consumer-strategy-and-vision-on-one-page/"&gt;made bold predictions
    about Apple's entire consumer
    strategy&lt;/a&gt;
    in the future. Most of my predictions have come into reality five
    years
    after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src ="../../../../images/apple-strategy.jpg", width="800px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm very experienced in creating enthralling entertainment
    contents&lt;/em&gt; for mass distribution. On Oct 12, 2012, I directed and
    produced the &lt;a href="http://guizishanren.com/confession-of-a-stanford-sloan-fellow_20_dance-of-my-life/"&gt;wildly successful Stanford GSB Flash
    Mob&lt;/a&gt;
    that took place in Stanford Knight Management Center on Oct 12, and
    made it into a viral hit on Youtube. On Nov 12, I led a team of 26
    Sloans to perform &lt;a href="http://guizishanren.com/gangnam-style-goes-to-stanford-ncaa-half-time-show/"&gt;Gangnam Style during the half-time show of
    Stanford Men's Basketball
    Game&lt;/a&gt;
    in Maples Pavilion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm a hard-core user on most of the prevailing SNS platforms&lt;/em&gt;,
    such as Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram, Weibo (China). I have &lt;a href="http://www.weibo.com/zire"&gt;12,892
    followers on Weibo&lt;/a&gt;, China's largest
    social network (similar to Twitter), and &lt;a href="http://instagram.com/zire"&gt;2,400 followers on
    Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. I know very well how SNS have
    evolved over the last few years. My guides/walkthroughs on using
    &lt;a href="http://guizishanren.com/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-weibo/"&gt;Weibo&lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://guizishanren.com/instagram%EF%BC%8C%E6%91%84%E5%BD%B1%EF%BC%8C%E5%92%8C%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;
    have been widely quoted in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I hope I have convinced you that I will be a valuable
addition to your class. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term=""></category></entry><entry><title>A New Business Card</title><link href="http://guizishanren.com/posts/2012/12/a-new-business-card/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-12-10T01:13:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Herbert Yang</name></author><id>tag:guizishanren.com,2012-12-10:posts/2012/12/a-new-business-card/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Usually when I procrastinate on something, I'll try to find ways to
amuse myself and keep myself motivated. As I was procrastinating on the
preparation for the upcoming Accounting and Global Strategy final exams
over the weekend, I thought it would be fun to design my own business
cards for the Seattle trip next week. The staff at Palo Alto Fedex
office on California Ave was extremely helpful and gave me all the
necessary instructions. So I came up with this design using good old
PowerPoint. It worked well. The proof sample looked pretty sleek. I
shall receive the actual cards by Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../../images/bizcard_cover.png", width="800px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first came to Stanford GSB Sloan Program, I did not feel business
card was going to be of much use here in Stanford/the Bay area. The use
of business cards is not as prevalent as in China. Most people seem to
be content with getting a phone number/email by the end of a pleasant
conversation. It's not common to see people give out business cards
hard-selling themselves, at least not on Stanford campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../../images/bizcard_back.png", width="800px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, many Sloans still ordered the standard business cards
from Stanford Sloan Program, which has a nice Stanford logo.
Occasionally it's still useful, during info sessions or networking
events like Tailgate parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our Seattle company visit trip next week, more than 60 Sloans
will be meeting with alumni and executives from various companies. The
thought of so many of us giving out almost identical business cards to
the same VIP made me wonder, maybe this is the time to get creative. I
need to figure out a way to distinguish myself from others, and I should
use my business card as the most potent vehicle for my personal branding
- a subject that has been the center of attention among me, my brother
&lt;a href="http://www.steve-qing-yang.com/"&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt;, and some old and new friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is. The font is primarily Helvetica. The color for the cover
is tangerine. The "cloud" on the back took some painstaking effort to
complete - it was done manually by aligning every textbox into the right
position with the right color and font size, all in PowerPoint.
PowerPoint does a rather appalling job in rendering fonts. Some fonts
looked pretty goofy when the size was below 8. Fortunately PDF saved the
day. When I saved the PPT file as a PDF (on my Macbook Air), magically
PDF rendered all the fonts in their 100% glory and accuracy. Voila!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term=""></category></entry><entry><title>COASSF#25 - Summer Quarter Course Evaluation</title><link href="http://guizishanren.com/posts/2012/10/summer-quarter-course-evaluation/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-18T22:14:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Herbert Yang</name></author><id>tag:guizishanren.com,2012-10-18:posts/2012/10/summer-quarter-course-evaluation/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;... continued from the explanation of &lt;a href="../../../2012/10/evaluate-course-with-CIDRAE/"&gt;CIDRAE Framework&lt;/a&gt;, here is the evaluation for the courses I took in the summer quarter of Stanford 2012-2013 in the Sloan Program.&lt;/p&gt;

Sloan Program&lt;/a&gt; individually, but I'm
afraid that my often highly opinionated remarks would hurt some feelings
and doom my future career in the Silicon Valley. So I developed a
framework during today's less-than-eventful class, called &lt;strong&gt;CIDRAE,&lt;/strong&gt; to
express a more balanced and comprehensive critique for each course. My
idea was inspired from the group exercise project (the U Penn PhD
curriculum one) for a course in the Fall Quarter &lt;a href="http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&amp;amp;filter-coursestatus-Active=on&amp;amp;page=0&amp;amp;catalog=&amp;amp;q=GSBGEN+239%3A+Sloan%3A+Executive+Communication+Strategies&amp;amp;collapse="&gt;GSBGEN239 Executive
Communication
Strategies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;ontents Usefulness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How useful are the contents? How relevant are
they to me? Are they what I want to learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;nstructor's Presentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the instructor inspiring? Is his
presentation creative, engaging, or conducive for learning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;ynamics in Classroom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there usually a spirited discussion or debate among students in the class? Are students proactively sharing their views and experiences to enhance the overall learning for the class?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;eading Load&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How heavy is the reading material? Are they compulsory
or optional?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;ssignment/Project Load&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How heavy is the work load from assignments
and projects (individual and group)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;xam Pressure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How stressful is it to prepare for the exam? How
menacing does the exam look like? How much psychological pressure does
it impose on me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C, I, D more or less measure how much I get out of the course, and R, A,
E measure how much effort I need to put into the course. For every
course, I'll measure it under these six dimensions and assign a value
from 1 to 5. 5 is the highest extend, and 1 is the lowest extend. Also
it's worth noting that RAE reflects how I treat the course requirement,
rather than what is officially required by the syllabus. The entire
CIDRAE score is, therefore, highly idiosyncratic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;RAE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;CIDRAE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RAE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Index&lt;/span&gt;

followed me with curiosity through all these years and numerous avant
garden social networks.  I've moved back to the States since June and I
haven't got the chance to call up many friends (actually, most) in the
States yet to let them know of this news, which is very uncharacteristic
of me. On the other side of the ocean, many of my friends in China are
wondering why I suddenly disappeared in Beijing's social scene. The
questions I've got a lot lately are: &lt;em&gt;Why are you here in Stanford? Why
are you back to the States? Why are you moving your home base again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly I was a bit jaded explaining my recent endeavor to my
friends, who constitute a fairly substantial group across the Pacific.
Our annual newsletter at the end of the year still serves as an
effective way to keep all our cared ones updated - a tradition we have
been practicing since 2004 when living in Boston. However I stopped
writing the English version of the newsletter two years ago because a
Chinese version alone already exhausted all my creativity and
inspiration (I don't think any English newsletter can beat my Chinese
&lt;a href="http://www.guizishanren.com/?p=549"&gt;newsletter of 2010&lt;/a&gt; and 2011.
They're not as good as Umberto Eco's, but they are decent and pride
attempts in that direction). The problem with the newsletter is that
we've moving our lives too fast for the newsletter to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeble attempt on Sina Weibo also got buried in the sea of tweets
quickly. I wrote
this&lt;a href="http://weibo.com/1270520763/ykmem37YZ"&gt;《出师表·2012》&lt;/a&gt;in May 22,
but Sina Weibo already started its irreversible decline and much fewer
users are still active. Nothing of much substance can really leave a
trail on twitter-esque Sina Weibo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's my latest update and why everything leads to right here, right
now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had US greencard since 2006. My wife and I actually gave up
Singapore PR (permanent residence) after we got greencards (looking back
that was probably not a smart idea, from a personal tax standpoint)
thinking that US Greencard was all that we needed. When I left Boston to
join a tech startup in Beijing in 2008, I sort of gave up Greencard
mentally, expecting to settle down in Beijing in years to come. We did
settle down in Beijing and lived there for more than four years, during
which I joined two ambitious startup companies working with some of the
most influential VC firms. For a variety of reasons that can easily fill
up my first novel and two long and exciting TV drama series, these two
companies couldn't complete its IPO. So at the end of 2011 I was
weighing other options going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then as we were trying to enter US for our West Coast Highway 101 road
trip, we found that our greencard status faced serious challenge because
we did not stay physically inside US long enough. Long story short,
after consulting multiple immigration lawyers in the Bay area, we saw
two options in front of us with no middle-ground: either we move our
home base here, or we run the risk of giving up greencard on our next
trip back to US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't want to give up greencard, so we decided to move back to US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving back to US seems to be against the current trend, as many Chinese
have flocked to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong in recent years to
pursue their wild wild east dreams. US was still recovering slowly from
the painful sub-prime crisis since 2008 and China has been rising fast
into a superpower, at least economically. Colorful and exciting
rugs-to-riches stories roll off tongues in the bars and Starbucks in
Beijing and Shanghai while young people fantasize being the next Jack
Ma, Pony Ma, Robin Li, or Neil Shen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However there are certain things that we value very much and we find
very hard to come by in the environment where we became so intimate with
in the last few years. I won't go into details here though. Come to
Stanford and we can exchange some thoughts over a few glasses of
Zinfandel. The only thing I wouldn't mind sharing here is tax, because
it seems to be the first thing that comes to mind for many friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US is perceived to be a very high-taxed country, which is largely true.
Nonetheless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China's tax rate is just as high as US&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China's tax laws' development in recent years is clearly on a
    trajectory to becoming more and more like US tax laws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically China also taxes its residents on a global basis, just
    like US does. It's obviously very hard to enforce, but its
    principles are very similar to those of US tax laws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US' tax rate is indeed very high for salaried workers, but if you
    work for yourself as an entrepreneur, you can maintain a fairly low
    effective tax rate. Romney famously has a tax rate of only 14%.
    Buffett keeps complaining his tax rate is too low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, US' tax laws are well developed and there are
    many vehicles you can explore to bring down your effective tax laws.
    China's tax laws are far behind in sophistication. Some people might
    roll their eyes now and say I can get a lot of "gray" income in
    China through cash. Yes that's true. If that's your cup of tea or if
    you work in government departments/agencies, by all means stay where
    you are. Good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are actually benefits associated with paying high tax rate in
    US - you get the best protection of your personal assets. At a
    certain point in our lives,  tax rate is really not the top concern.
    Easy come, easy go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making up our mind to move over, we thought West Coast would be a
better choice as it's closer to Beijing/Shanghai with non-stop flight.
The weather is also much nicer on the west. Most importantly Silicon
Valley is here, where I can start from scratch to continue/pursue my
entrepreneurial ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I talked to friends in the Bay area to find out the startup scene in
the valley, I asked them what would be a necessary factor to startup
success. Invariably the answer was college network (company network has
little use, unless you've made a lot of money together with a
single-digit employ ID number). This sounds like a sad sad reality for
me since my alma mater is National University of Singapore (NUS). NUS is
an excellent university and it had huge influence over me in my
formative years, however its network in the US is fairly limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last day in Palo Alto during our Jan 2012 California trip, we
drove to Sand Hill Road on a pilgrimage to take a look at some of the
legendary venture capital firms here. Standing outside Andreessen
Horowitz's office looking at the sunset, I thought about that afternoon
of 12 years ago when &lt;a href="http://www.steve-qing-yang.com"&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; brought me
here for the first time and showed me around. KPCB was there, so
unassuming and low-profiled. I had no idea what KPCB was yet at that
time, but I remembered Steve told me the day would come when I shall
come back here to raise capital from those most prestigious and powerful
investment firms in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...just like that, an idea naturally stroke us, why not go to
Stanford, which is right here in the heart of Silicon Valley with the
best alumni network there is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already knew about &lt;a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sloan"&gt;Stanford's Sloan
Fellow&lt;/a&gt; program from a good friend
who graduated there in 2010. I  just never pictured myself in this
program because until very recently  I was very much immersed in the
crazy and non-stop business and social life in Beijing. Now all of a
sudden, coming to Stanford seems to make all the senses of the world. I
would not want to be anywhere but Silicon Valley and which university
would serve as a better platform to usher me into the startup and
investment circles of the valley?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this seed had been planted, the rest of the execution was fairly
easy. The past four years in Beijing saw tremendous professional and
personal growth for me. I've been through a lot. Maybe I'm yet to figure
out what works best, but at least I've known enough what does not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am, in Stanford Graduate Business School's Sloan Fellow
program. My decision on Stanford was straightforward because it was
significantly &lt;a href="http://www.guizishanren.com/?p=871"&gt;location-based&lt;/a&gt;,
which was by the way in sharp contrast to my friend &lt;a href="http://sten.tamkivi.com/2012/02/why-and-how-i-became-a-stanford-student/"&gt;Sten's highly
methodological and scientific
approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many friends would ask me, so... is this move going to be permanent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know, my friend. I really don't know. When we lived in
Cambridge, MA, we loved Charles River, Cambridge and Boston, and never
thought about leaving there. When we moved to Beijing and bought a house
there, we thought Beijing was the best place for us. We seem to have a
blast everywhere and tend to live our lives to the fullest in general,
regardless of where we are.  When we moved here... I no longer want to
make any speculation and I no longer have any concept of "permanent" or
"temporary". We live our lives, day by day. Carpe diem in Stanford!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term=""></category></entry><entry><title>Can You as a CFO survive the journey of leading a pre-IPO company to IPO?</title><link href="http://guizishanren.com/posts/2012/02/can-you-as-a-cfo-survive-the-journey-of-leading-a-pre-ipo-company-to-ipo/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-24T14:29:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Herbert Yang</name></author><id>tag:guizishanren.com,2012-02-24:posts/2012/02/can-you-as-a-cfo-survive-the-journey-of-leading-a-pre-ipo-company-to-ipo/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you join a pre-IPO company as its CFO, the holy grail (well, for most) is to get this baby to IPO.

&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;以为自己N年前就写过这篇文章了，在网站上遍寻不获，为方便转发，只好重新码字。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在考虑换工作或者职业发展的下一步时，通常有这么几大因素需要考虑：老板，行业，地点，公司，职位，工作（工作环境，同事，交通，薪水，新技能。。。这些技术细节不是本文关注的焦点），按照重要性从高到低的排序如下：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;老板&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;这是最关键的因素，其重要性超过其他五项总和。跟对了人，其他所有问题都只是暂时的问题，都可以最终解决；跟错了人，则会陷入万丈深渊无法自拔。老板招人，但我们也在寻找最欣赏自己的伯乐，这个选择是双向的。人跟人之间的沟通很微妙，跟一个知己之间产生的化学作用可遇而不可求。遇上一个了解自己潜能，欣赏自己个性的老板，是万金难买的RP大爆发事件，要好好珍惜。在中国，这个因素尤其至关重要。一个好的老板，Ta的资源是跨行业跨地域的，可以带来无尽的新机会。在美国，这个因素的重要性稍微降低一些，因为美国地域太广阔（不像中国，大部分资源都集中在北京和上海），行业分化程度高，会削弱一个超级老板的影响力（但仍然是六项之首）。当目前的工作出现迷雾和不确定因素时，先看看老板的意向，看看你的下一步会对Ta产生什么样的影响，会帮助Ta解决什么样的问题，不要天真地一味从自己的利益角度出发考虑问题。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;行业&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;女怕嫁错郎，男怕入错行，这句话是公理。一个人的履历价值主要体现在两方面：行业经验/domain
expertise和功能技术/functional skills. 要达到行业顶端，domain
expertise是必要条件；到达了一个垂直行业的顶端后，可以凭借functional
skill进行跨行业的移动。Domain
expertise是靠一个工作一个工作积累起来的，频繁转行是大忌，青春时光只有二十年，也就经得起折腾个四五次，龟兔赛跑的道理浅显但常常被人遗忘。只有很少数的幸运儿在大学一毕业就能找到自己终身喜欢从事的事情，大多数人都需要经历几次行业的转变才会发现真爱。寻找自己热爱的事业，是一个更加宏大的终极命题，改日另行详述。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;地点&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;一个人三十岁以后的走势，社会关系是其主要推动力，而社会关系有极强的地域性。每次更换生活城市，所有的社会关系都得更新一遍，代价太大了。生活地点一旦定下来，买房，买车，都是迟早的规定动作，否则周围的人知道你是个浮萍，是个匆匆过客，不会在你身上投资过多的时间成本。对于想要回国的海外游子们，如果最终目的地是国内，则晚回不如早回。早一天回来，早一天开始积累人脉资源，没有其他捷径。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;公司&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;。。。没什么好说的，除了：行业比公司重要，公司跟职位之间的排序可以更换，但大多数时候公司比职位更重要，因为，公司比职位实在。很多时候，不同行业，不同公司里的看起来貌似相同的职业难以作比较，但公司之间是可以在品牌，美誉，规模上产生直接对比关系的。公司的存在感要比职位强烈得多。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;职位&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;职位的描述比较虚，表面上看不出来有什么不一样的地方，只有做了才知道，所以它的重要性也比较靠后。在很多行业里，有一些大家都公认的职位，这些职位的虚名可能比实际的工作性质更加重要。你要么做过，要么没做过，很多人就是凭照你的职位来定义你的能力。这虽然不是一个很公平的判断方法，但实际情况往往就是如此。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;工作&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;排名最后的，是你实际在做什么。这个因素调整起来相对比较容易，属于转变成本最低的。很多人的眼睛里就只盯着这个最浅显表象的因素，实在是本末倒置。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day in GE. I've decided to veer away from the beaten
path and indulge myself in some of my long-term passion and interests.
GE has given me every professional skill I have and its affiliation
accounts for 62.78% of all my friends. So, it means a lot to me. What
makes my eight years of GE experience such a joy ride is you,
unmistakably you. Thank you for being there with me. Thank you for the
good times and I hope to continue them in the future. Well, I'm supposed
to be a trained Jedi Knight wielding a light saber to save the day every
8.0 months and I'm supposed to be pretty cool about all these
moving-around. Guess I've gone soft over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to give me a buzz at 1-617-852-6594(cell), if you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stop by Republic of Cambridge - I mean, Boston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;struggling with some monumental Mac-vs-PC decision - Steve Jobs really owes me, like, a lo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not sure what movies to watch for the weekend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can't decide between a Stevie Wonder concert and a Smashing Pumpkins one - fantasize about going to Alaska, Tibet, Santorini, Paris, Provence or
Italy but need convincing photo evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ponder over some really stupid and absurd ideas about technology, media and entertainment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wondering OMG what is going on in China and want to get a train ride,
literally and figuratively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or just anything else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I believe a non-company email address lays down a solid
foundation for long-term relationship. Please send me your personal one
(if you don't have one yet then get one). If you prefer any other means

Immelt’s got a tough job. He’s been relentlessly doing everything humanely possible to make the same GE sales pitch to analysts, major shareholders, the board, customers, employees, Dave Calhoun and himself. Fortune’s November issue runs a cover story on him and the photo displays his now completely-turned-silver hair. I recall his hair was mostly black when I saw him in Tokyo in mid–2001. Despite the best efforts from one of the best CEOs working today, investors are through buying it. GE stock is still going nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean while a noticeable &lt;em&gt;exodus&lt;/em&gt; is taking place with some of GE’s brightest executives. Cerberus Capital Management, the all-mighty hedge fund that trumped KKR in the then-landmark GMAC deal, has become a hub for GE alumni. GE managers, some of who report directly to Immelt’s staff (which means they have a legitimate shot at being CEO/CFO for many Fortune 500 companies, except for the top 20) , are quickly populating the ranks of various private equity and hedge fund firms. The exodus
reached alarming level when Dave Calhoun, a 27-year GE lifer who was once a front-runner in the horse race to succeed Jack Welch and now a vice chairman of the company, quitted in Aug 2006 to run a far smaller private media company VNU (backed by KKR, Blackstone and Carlyle), with a rumored $100MM potential incentive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much has been talked about the benefits of turning a company into a &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; one. The advantages are especially pronounced given today’s corporate governance activism (whether an ordinary man in the street agrees or not, some managers ARE worth hundreds of million dollars in
pay, not to mention private jet or Manhattan apartments) and Sarbanes Oxley Act. So my initial thought on how to salvage GE was on this path - what if we can LBO GE…? Well I quickly dismissed that myself. Indeed PE and Hedge Funds (the line to distinguish the two is fairly blur right now) are calling the shots all around, evidenced by the fact that the record for highest LBO deal has been set TWICE already in 2006, eclipsing the heyday of the greedy 80’s (on a side note, Lous Gestner - then in RJR Nabisco, is now back in the game with Carlyle, completing a full circle). Now they’re setting their eyes on Dell ($60BN) and Ford ($35BN). Only sky is the limit for those cowboys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However GE with $362BN market cap is clearly too much for &lt;em&gt;PE firms&lt;/em&gt; to make a run at. Besides the obvious financial hurdle, the current LBO model doesn’t fit for companies like GE or Apple. Among all others, the biggest change LBO brings to a public firm is that it puts a time stamp on the life of the company, which is otherwise presumed to exist in perpetuity. Live if you can make a change within the next five years; die if you can’t. That new corporate goal changes the entire mentality and easily solves the century-old agency problem. It makes a lot of sense if the company in its past life as a public entity is just an also-run. What if you’re already the market leader? What if your existence serves a higher purpose for the society at large, and for the sake for preserving mankind dignity your existence should be expected and allowed to last in perpetuity (Apple is an example; GE, hmm...arguably so)? Businesses of that nature probably won’t appreciate the short-term focus of PE firms, but ironically the structural advantages that PE firms can bring about are exactly what such businesses need so that they can: 1) focus on actually delivering the best products and services instead of utilizing management’s intellectual prowess in strategizing how to hit the EPS; 2) stop trying to figure out how to allocate income “stretch” targets; 3) leave the explanation of options backdating to accountants only; 4) forget about balancing double-digit growth in revenue, income, cash simultaneously while maintaining 20% ROE, which is a more formidable feat than proving Poincare Conjecture (go Perelman!); 5) sit down, have a cigar, and think about what is the next big thing that will reshape the planet and mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough said. So which model would fit GE? &lt;em&gt;Berkshire Hathaway&lt;/em&gt;’s is pretty close. Buffett essentially runs that as a private company - no meeting with street analysts, no earning forecast (if you don’t manage net income, how can you forecast? And then everyone says managing income is evil…duh?), no excessive sales pitch other than Buffett’s legendary annual letters. That culture is what GE needs to liberate its highly competent management team from numerous mundane short-term tasks and allow them to develop truly long-term vision and strategy for the company. Nonetheless, GE has another unique, insurmountable challenge - its size. Berkshire Hathaway has  $160BN market cap and GE’s more than twice of that. GE’s market cap has become so large and its business is
so diversified (the bite for being the all-time champion for diversification), it’ll just take too much market movement to nudge itsstock price. Unless GE has a true blockbuster product (like the light
bulb a century ago), investors can hardly get excited about its
performance (some washing machine and x-ray machines every now and then
ain’t enough). Over the years the giant company has turned into a
process-driven business rather than product/service-driven one.
Everybody knows GE will methodically meet its every target and continue
to churn out excellent managers, but few know GE Capital alone can rival
Citi Group, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase in size and product
offering. GE is paying the price for its own size - its far-ranging
products and services are all excellent in their own right and market
segments, but they are trivialized when everything is added up to form
the sum of GE. There is a ton of value within each GE division it almost
seems that the entropy is lost or just cancelled out with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore IMHO the best way to unlock GE’s value is to &lt;em&gt;break it up&lt;/em&gt;. It
can be split into six businesses - Commercial Finance, Consumer Finance,
Infrastructure, Healthcare, Industrial and transportation. It’s not
exactly a clean-cut but it’s doable. Some of those P&amp;amp;Ls will be innerly
harmonized enough to form their own identity, culture and mission to go
to greatness on their own. Some of them may be more challenged with an
identity crisis, but they will survive. GE’s portfolio model (used to be
callled SBU.. Anyone still remember?) has been extremely successful in
the past, and to this date is still the envy for many other companies.
It has four major advantages, but I’ll argue none of them should be a
show-stopper to break up GE. GE’s old model has four distinctive
features. In today’s world, either they’re no longer valid, or they’re
no longer part of cost of living to stay in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Resource Training&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People is the best product coming out of GE. Millions of young, ambitious professionals flock to GE’s leadership training programs for their assortment of business and management training that is unparalleled in the world, both in breadth and depth. Once you’re marked as an “A” player, you’re expected to move to a new location, join another division, take new role and responsibilities every 18 to 24 months (yeah your kids will be multi-lingual, cross-culturally attuned
by birth right). However, given GE’s siiiiiiiize, even after break-up,
the new baby-GEs will still have enough critical mass to provide
training opportunities in almost the same magnitude. All of them are
already bona fide global platforms. In addition, people start domain
specialization fairly soon within 2–3 years after they join the company.
If I started out with NBC at Rockefeller Center, would I really want to
accelerate my career in Cincinnati in GE Transportation (big plant
there)? Well, I’m sure I can find equally appealing placement elsewhere
in NBC Universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capital Allocation / the science of levering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magic mojo for GE that once dazzled many competitors.Some businesses like GE Industrial are cash cows that don’t make too much net income but generate cash consistently. GE consolidates that cash (the treasury operation is a wonder to behold) and throw that around in high-growth businesses to make acquisitions. It’s a very efficient use of capital and only possible when you have a mix of industrial/capital and “cash cow”/“star” businesses. I would very much like to indulge in a more detailed discussion of “levering” for people who still recall the basic corporate finance principles from Brealey and Myers, but I should probably stop right here since I’m not entirely sure such levering mechanism is public knowledge. Mr. Bill Gross from Pimco almost stepped on this in his 2002 crusade on GE. Long story short, GE recapitalized quickly in response to Gross’ assault, and that discretion on capital allocation among its myriad of businesses is now gone (there are other benefits of NOT doing that though). Also, there is so much liquidity in the market now - GE is no longer the privileged few who can amass large sum of capital on a minute’s notice (just think about Blackstone’s $20BN fund). This paragraph may have unintended gaps in logical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portfolio Diversification&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old topic with a new twist in the age of ultra rapid value creation.
Business 101 says that diversification is useless (“home-made” effect),
and in fine print below it also says that “… except for GE”. GE has been
the consummate poster-boy defending the value of diversification. It’s a
simple premise: its 1,000+ businesses are all in different industry
cycles; at any given point, some will do well and some will not. The
good and bad cancel out each other and usually what is left is gravy. It
is a good, almost risk-free strategy, but not a particularly exciting
one. Andy Grove says “Only the Paranoid Survive” (btw, that book doesn’t
offer that much insight really. The old man is repeating himself too
much), I say " Only the Double-Down Survive“. GE’s diversification has
created a false sense of safety. 10% year-over-year steady growth may
suffice in the past 100 years, but it’s not going to cut it in the new
century when a garage business of 40 people can create  $1.6BN over 18
months. On the other hand, GE Capital raised many eyebrows when it
quietly started dominating GE’s balance sheet and profit and loss
statement left and right. Indeed, if every soul on the street looks at
GE as a finance company, GE will have to carry the same inspiring PE
ratio as those financial firms - not a pretty outlook (but in a way it’s
already happening). Therefore GE has to”balance" its Capital business
growth with that of its Industrial business. I say, if GE Capital can
grow 30% a year, let it roll and maybe that’ll be more than enough to
make up for a lower PE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Corporate Brand Image&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another argument for one GE lies in the brand name of GE. This is a
touchy subject and I hold tremendous pride for this name. However I
would tentatively toy around some timid thoughts that may suggest GE’s
size is approaching to a level that could diminish its image and brand
recognition. If one think about “What is GE?”, an old tag line emerges
“Bring Good Things to Life”. True, GE used to exist for betterment of
mankind in general, and it actually carried out that mission fairly
well. What does it mean today? With all the breakthroughs in consumer
technology and unprecedented business models, it doesn’t mean a whole
lot. GE has way too many products and services for average consumer to
make out a sketch of what it really is. It’s not like
Apple=Innovation+Cool, or Walmart=Evil Empire/The Only Mall That Matters
For Your Neighbourhood, or Google=Wonder Boy Wandering in Wonderland.
Regardless of whether those images are good or bad, they are engraved in
people’s minds and investors can easily relate to them. Immelt saw the
statement become a bit staled and hollow. He made a sweeping change in
2005, opting for “Imagination at Work”. Immelt is smart. He certainly
felt the coming of an identity crisis. Do people really buy that? Only
time will tell but I can at least argue that the inclusion of certain
businesses do not necessarily inspire aura of “imagination” for average
Joe. If GE were broken up into a few pieces, the new baby-GEs will be
more recognizable with potentially more coherent messages to convey to
their respective targeted customer segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To round up my 20 cents, going private will give GE much needed
structural and process advantages to let it focus on running the
business. Today’s PE models and Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway model
provide bits of the elements that will be helpful to GE, but the
transition from current GE to those models is beyond the capacity and
technology of today’s financial market (we need another Michael Milken).
A detour that may get GE there and fully unlock GE’s value seems to be
breaking it up into a few baby-GEs. It’s an audacious thought that
challenges several conventional wisdoms built around GE’s success to
date, but in today’s changed environment, those words of wisdom are in
need for new validation and interpretation anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that make any sense to you … no?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term=""></category></entry></feed>
