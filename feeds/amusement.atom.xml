English speech contest for high-school students broadcast live on
China's national television (CCTV) at age 15, to delivering a company
presentation on China's largest VC/PE firm - CDH's annual LP conference
in Venetian, Macau. This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a
"ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows
of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on
April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before
it in dust. It was finished right at the very last second before class
president John Barton finished his introduction of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music is &lt;em&gt;Robert Miles' Children (Dream Version)&lt;/em&gt;. The pictures came
from a variety of sources, including Her Extraordinaire Ede Tamkivi and
Jacqueline Wu, two best photographers of our class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the way I've always imagined our story should be told.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term=""></category></entry></feed>
