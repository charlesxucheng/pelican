                            <p class="post-meta"><p>If you are a native Chinese, please skip. If you think General Tao chicken is really delicious, please skip. If you are not a native Chinese but aspire for good Chinese food once in a while, read on. When you walk in a Chinese restaurant, whether in the Bay Area, New York, Los Angeles or Hawaii, you might fancy ordering like a native Chinese and get something really authentic, not invented-in-America kind of Chinese food (such as General Tao chicken). The challenge is, it's very difficult to navigate through a Chinese restaurant's menu as no one really understands the English portion of it. Chinese would just go straight to the last two pages that are written entirely in Chinese (so called "Chef's Recommendations") to order. If you don't read Chinese, this option is not available to you. Well, unless you read on ...</p></p>

                            <p class="post-meta"><p>Many of my friends including myself have contemplated creating new business models in the travel space over the years. This is an interesting area that resonates with many people's personal experiences and something that almost everyone can relate to. We often feel there is something missing here or there, and it's not easy to articulate exactly where and what. Travel business, unlike movie and other business, is very hard to determine what is the basic element for a single data entry point. From the perspective of a database (which is the backbone of every Internet business), if the data point cannot be universally defined and understood, then there is no database to speak of and no business to be built upon.</p></p>

                            <p class="post-meta"><p>When I look back at the past year in Stanford/GSB/Sloan Fellow Program and reflect what was it that we tried to get out of this incredible experience, I think our goals fall into six mutually exclusive and collective exhaustive categories, namely, PFIKER. It is important for us to know what our goals are, from Day One into the community, so that we can strategize priorities, plan our academic and social life accordingly, to get the most out of our time in Stanford. 12 months go by really, really fast. Without clear goals in mind, it's easy to let the time and opportunities slip through our fingers before we know it.</p></p>

                            <p class="post-meta"><p>From a recent project in my favorite course of the quarter: OB388 Leadership in Entertainment Business, my group researched and analyzed the success of K-Pop. During this exhilarating intellectual process, I came up with this graph that illustrates how to find the optimal path of nurturing a star from scratch. The horizontal dimension, from low to high, represents the technical difficulty of acquiring certain skills (which are also the cultural products those stars will eventually produce) for a star in an entertainment business. The vertical dimension, from low to high, represents  the cultural barrier those cultural products will encounter when they are delivered to a foreign culture (like from South Korea to America).</p></p>

This diagram is built on a framework I developed a while ago, which was written in Chinese and I haven't got the chance to translate into English (if you know of any free secretary service, please let me know.

So I developed a framework during today's less-than-eventful class, called CIDRAE to express a more balanced and comprehensive critique for each course. My idea was inspired from the group exercise project (the U Penn PhD curriculum one) for a course in the Fall Quarter.</p></p>
