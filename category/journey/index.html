Many friends and family members have given us great advice and very useful gifts. Here's a list of the 10 most useful and essential items we would recommend to all our friends who are expecting babies. We're very grateful to these tools.

It's a lunch session where everyone brings lunchbox and listens to a classmate's self-introduction called BBL. BBL is to talk about yourself, let your classmates understand better who you are, where you come from, and where are you going (这是北大门卫的三个提问么？）. It's an open canvas and you can freely draw up whatever you want, talk about whatever topics that you think might be interesting for others to know. Usually one BBL goes for 15 minutes and the program staff tries to have 4 BBLs during</p></p>

As I was procrastinating on the preparation for the upcoming Accounting and Global Strategy final exams over the weekend, I thought it would be fun to design my own business cards for the Seattle trip next week. The staff at Palo Alto Fedex office on California Ave was extremely helpful and gave me all the necessary instructions. So I came up with this design using good old PowerPoint. It worked well. The proof sample looked pretty sleek. I shall receive the actual cards by Monday.</p></p>

                            <p class="post-meta"><p>I guess I owe an explanation to many of my friends who have watched and followed me with curiosity through all these years and numerous avant garden social networks.  I've moved back to the States since June and I haven't got the chance to call up many friends (actually, most) in the States yet to let them know of this news, which is very uncharacteristic of me. On the other side of the ocean, many of my friends in China are wondering why I suddenly disappeared in Beijing's social scene. The questions I've got a lot lately are: why are you here in Stanford?why are you back to the States?why are you moving your home base again?</p></p>
