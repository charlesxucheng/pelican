	<h2>A New Business Card</h2>

	<div class="summary"><p>Usually when I procrastinate on something, I'll try to find ways to amuse myself and keep myself motivated. As I was procrastinating on the preparation for the upcoming Accounting and Global Strategy final exams over the weekend, I thought it would be fun to design my own business cards for the Seattle trip next week. The staff at Palo Alto Fedex office on California Ave was extremely helpful and gave me all the necessary instructions. So I came up with this design using good old PowerPoint. It worked well. The proof sample looked pretty sleek. I shall receive the actual cards by Monday.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../../posts/2012/12/a-new-business-card/">more…</a>

	<div class="summary"><p>I guess I owe an explanation to many of my friends who have watched and followed me with curiosity through all these years and numerous avant garden social networks.  I've moved back to the States since June and I haven't got the chance to call up many friends (actually, most) in the States yet to let them know of this news, which is very uncharacteristic of me. On the other side of the ocean, many of my friends in China are wondering why I suddenly disappeared in Beijing's social scene. The questions I've got a lot lately are: why are you here in Stanford?why are you back to the States?why are you moving your home base again?</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../../posts/2012/09/why-here-why-now-why-again/">more…</a>

	<div class="summary"><p>Today is my last day in GE. I've decided to veer away from the beaten path and indulge myself in some of my long-term passion and interests. GE has given me every professional skill I have and its affiliation accounts for 62.78% of all my friends. So, it means a lot to me. What makes my eight years of GE experience such a joy ride is you, unmistakably you. Thank you for being there with me. Thank you for the good times and I hope to continue them in the future.
