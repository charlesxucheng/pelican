    <div class="summary"><p>In the first week of the third quarter of my 12-month Sloan academic year, I find myself spending at least 2-3 hours every day this week in a perpetual (often futile ) attempt to optimize my courses for this quarter. The exhaustive and reiterative process has been very tiring, but much needed. Because the course selection of Winter Quarter is critical, unique and sets the course for half of my Sloan year. In Summer and Fall Quarter, our curriculum was largely the same with limited variations - there was not much we can do to adjust the curriculum. Things start getting interesting in Winter Quarter, when we only have two classes together (Finance and Marketing) and need to fill up more than 50% of our academic calendar with self-selected coures from GSB and other school. The below 15 factors, in descending order of importance, might be helpful in strategizing your most optimal course portfolio, from the perspective of a GSB Sloan.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../../posts/2013/01/15-things-to-know-in-strategizing-your-course-portfolio/">more…</a>

    <div class="summary"><p>dMediais a course from d.school of Stanford in the coming Winter Quarter. As most other design-themed courses from Stanford's trendy Design School, it has a somewhat idiosyncratic application, in which I need to do this: "Share a single url that describes how your past experience has prepared you to contribute to the dmedia class- a portfolio, a pdf, a flickr page, a twitter feed, a video, an example of your work online-preferably something we haven't thought of... it's up to you. Please make sure your name &amp; a title / description on the url is visible so we know it's you." So I've laid out my answer in this page - why I think I can make a meaningful contribution to the dmedia class.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../../posts/2012/12/application-to-dmedia/">more…</a>

    <div class="summary"><p>I've been thinking about evaluating each course I've taken in Stanford Sloan Program individually, but I'm afraid that my often highly opinionated remarks would hurt some feelings and doom my future career in the Silicon Valley. So I developed a framework during today's less-than-eventful class, called CIDRAE to express a more balanced and comprehensive critique for each course. My idea was inspired from the group exercise project (the U Penn PhD curriculum one) for a course in the Fall Quarter.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../../posts/2012/10/evaluate-course-with-CIDRAE/">more…</a>
