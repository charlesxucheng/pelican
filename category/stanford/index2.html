Surprise #1, this was actually a very accurate quote from me, though I have no idea how the magazine got it. Surprise #2, the editor thoughtfully used my previous Facebook profile photo instead of the current Jack Sparrow one ... nice touch there.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../../posts/2013/03/stanford-business-magazine-quote/">more…</a>

We squeezed out every inch in Havana Room but still could not find enough chairs/tables for all the Sloans and the partners. The party followed a format that was familiar to every Mainland Chinese - a gala filled with delicious food, baijiu (Chinese white wine, very hard-core liquor), stage performances, and variety shows. Not only it was a banquet of food and drink, but also it was a total cultural immersion of three hours in which I walked through five parts of some interesting elements of Chinese culture.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../../posts/2013/03/chinese-new-year-party/">more…</a>

    <div class="summary"><p>One of the benefits of sitting right next to my Sloan-mate Nicki Carter, who is co-leading an admirable and spirited effort of publishing Yearbook of Sloan Class of 2013,  is that I can rest assured to receive regular reminder about my yearbook message status for no less than ... four times a week. After leading Nicki's "Hall of Shame" for many weeks in a row, I decided to redeem  myself in front of Nicki and get it over with. For someone with a petty education background prior to Stanford, I actually don't think I've ever written a yearbook message before. So I did a bit of research to see what this whole yearbook message thing is about in US, and I've arrived at the following takeaways</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../../posts/2013/03/my-yearbook-message-for-Stanford-Sloan/">more…</a>
