                            <p class="post-meta"><p>This series ran for 62 episodes, taking notes and reflections during my 12 months in Stanford Graduate School of Business' Master of Science for Experienced Leaders (MSx, aka, Sloan Fellow) program. The original episodes were scattered around in my blog, together with photo series, dance videos, rock band videos, and self-invented theoretical frameworks. I didn't intend to put them in nice order because the structure of this blog was meant to force readers to read every article. This series is not finished yet. Despite of the various works I've done during the Sloan year, I'm yet to unveil my most satisfactory and ambitious project for my distinguished Sloan Class of 2013. Tentatively I'll debut that on our ten year anniversary dinner and dance.</p></p>

                            <p class="post-meta"><p>When I look back at the past year in Stanford/GSB/Sloan Fellow Program and reflect what was it that we tried to get out of this incredible experience, I think our goals fall into six mutually exclusive and collective exhaustive categories, namely, PFIKER. It is important for us to know what our goals are, from Day One into the community, so that we can strategize priorities, plan our academic and social life accordingly, to get the most out of our time in Stanford. 12 months go by really, really fast. Without clear goals in mind, it's easy to let the time and opportunities slip through our fingers before we know it.</p></p>

                            <p class="post-meta"><p>From a recent project in my favorite course of the quarter: OB388 Leadership in Entertainment Business, my group researched and analyzed the success of K-Pop. During this exhilarating intellectual process, I came up with this graph that illustrates how to find the optimal path of nurturing a star from scratch. The horizontal dimension, from low to high, represents the technical difficulty of acquiring certain skills (which are also the cultural products those stars will eventually produce) for a star in an entertainment business. The vertical dimension, from low to high, represents  the cultural barrier those cultural products will encounter when they are delivered to a foreign culture (like from South Korea to America).</p></p>

This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a "ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before it in dust. It was finished right at the very last second before class president John Barton finished his introduction of me.</p></p>

                            <p class="post-meta"><p>In descending order of importance, Complete your Linkedin profile. Linkedin has been used extensively by business schools, head hunters, and HR recruitment officers of many companies in US. It's gone mainstream and become a must-have in Stanford GSB. If you're looking for a job after Stanford, you can probably afford not to have a Facebook account, but you can't afford to have no Linkedin account. Linkedin helps to validate your professional history and it currently owns this market space. Get your personal linkedin URL and don't use the default system-generated random link, which no one remembers and looks amateurish. Spend quality time to polish and complete the Linkedin profile. A well updated Linkedin profile takes long time to fine-tune.</p></p>

Surprise #2, the editor thoughtfully used my previous Facebook profile photo instead of the current Jack Sparrow one ... nice touch there.</p></p>
