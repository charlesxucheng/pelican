This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a "ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before it in dust.

	<div class="summary"><p>On February 8, 2013, I emceed Sloan's Chinese New Year Party, which made history by becoming the most attended self-organized Sloan event with roughly 180 people (120 adults + 60 kids), in true Chinese fashion. We squeezed out every inch in Havana Room but still could not find enough chairs/tables for all the Sloans and the partners. The party followed a format that was familiar to every Mainland Chinese - a gala filled with delicious food, baijiu (Chinese white wine, very hard-core liquor), stage performances, and variety shows. Not only it was a banquet of food and drink, but also it was a total cultural immersion of three hours in which I walked through five parts of some interesting elements of Chinese culture.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/03/chinese-new-year-party/">more…</a>

All good things will come to an end, and our wonderful journey at Sloan Fellow Program in Stanford GSB is of no exception. The question is: how can we make the most out of this 12-month period?

As I was procrastinating on the preparation for the upcoming Accounting and Global Strategy final exams over the weekend, I thought it would be fun to design my own business cards for the Seattle trip next week. The staff at Palo Alto Fedex office on California Ave was extremely helpful and gave me all the necessary instructions. So I came up with this design using good old PowerPoint. It worked well. The proof sample looked pretty sleek. I shall receive the actual cards by Monday.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2012/12/a-new-business-card/">more…</a>
