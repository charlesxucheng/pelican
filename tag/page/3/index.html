	<div class="summary"><p>I've been thinking about evaluating each course I've taken in Stanford Sloan Program individually, but I'm afraid that my often highly opinionated remarks would hurt some feelings and doom my future career in the Silicon Valley. So I developed a framework during today's less-than-eventful class, called CIDRAE to express a more balanced and comprehensive critique for each course. My idea was inspired from the group exercise project (the U Penn PhD curriculum one) for a course in the Fall Quarter.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2012/10/evaluate-course-with-CIDRAE/">more…</a>

	<div class="summary"><p>I guess I owe an explanation to many of my friends who have watched and followed me with curiosity through all these years and numerous avant garden social networks.  I've moved back to the States since June and I haven't got the chance to call up many friends (actually, most) in the States yet to let them know of this news, which is very uncharacteristic of me. On the other side of the ocean, many of my friends in China are wondering why I suddenly disappeared in Beijing's social scene. The questions I've got a lot lately are: why are you here in Stanford?why are you back to the States?why are you moving your home base again?</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2012/09/why-here-why-now-why-again/">more…</a>

GE has given me every professional skill I have and its affiliation accounts for 62.78% of all my friends. So, it means a lot to me. What makes my eight years of GE experience such a joy ride is you, unmistakably you. Thank you for being there with me. Thank you for the good times and I hope to continue them in the future.

	<div class="summary"><p>GE’s stock has been in a 5-year slump since 2001. Immelt’s got a tough job. He’s been relentlessly doing everything humanely possible to make the same GE sales pitch to analysts, major shareholders, the board, customers, employees, Dave Calhoun and himself. Fortune’s November issue runs a cover story on him and the photo displays his now completely-turned-silver hair. I recall his hair was mostly black when I saw him in Tokyo in mid–2001. Despite the best efforts from one of the best CEOs working today, investors are through buying it. GE stock is still going nowhere.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2006/05/break-up-GE-to-unlock-its-value/">more…</a>
