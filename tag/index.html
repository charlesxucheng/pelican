	<div class="summary"><p>Joseph D. Grant County Park is located toward the end end of the Bay Area in San Jose, about 40-minute drive from Palo Alto. We came here in early spring trying to catch some wild flowers. Didn't see much blossom yet but the scenery on the hill was quite a treat. There were not too many people in the park. Nearby the park there are numerous biking routes. Right off the parking lot there is a small lake.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2014/03/hiking-joseph-d-grant-county-park-east-bay/">more…</a>

This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a "ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before it in dust. It was finished right at the very last second before class president John Barton finished his introduction of me.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/04/a-day-in-a-sloans-life/">more…</a>

	<div class="summary"><p>I've been thinking about evaluating each course I've taken in Stanford Sloan Program individually, but I'm afraid that my often highly opinionated remarks would hurt some feelings and doom my future career in the Silicon Valley. So I developed a framework during today's less-than-eventful class, called CIDRAE to express a more balanced and comprehensive critique for each course. My idea was inspired from the group exercise project (the U Penn PhD curriculum one) for a course in the Fall Quarter.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2012/10/evaluate-course-with-CIDRAE/">more…</a>

On the other side of the ocean, many of my friends in China are wondering why I suddenly disappeared in Beijing's social scene. The questions I've got a lot lately are: why are you here in Stanford?why are you back to the States?why are you moving your home base again?</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2012/09/why-here-why-now-why-again/">more…</a>
