    <div class="summary"><p>Since I get asked this question a lot, here's my current list. It's not meant to be an exhaustive list, just a collection of my personal favorites that I think my American friends may enjoy as well in recent years. 1. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1533117/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Let the Bullets Fly</a>, China, 2010, IMDB 7.2, directed by Wen Jiang, action/thriller. China's answer to Christopher Nolan's Inception, only better. It's directed by Wen Jiang, China (mainland)'s most talented film director, who left Yimou Zhang and Xiaogang Feng in dust with this period epic. Being an entertaining roller-coaster ride, it's also highly complex with profound and subtle references that challenge the most intellectual ones in Chinese audience. For non-Chinese, it'll be impossible to pick up the cultural and historical references and the many sub-plots, but you should still watch it just so that you can claim you've watched the one movie that absolutely defines the pinnacle of Chinese (mainland) film achievement.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../asian-movies-recommendations-for-american"> more </a>

    <h2>How to Order Like a Native Chinese in a Chinese Restaurant</h2>

    <div class="summary"><p>If you are a native Chinese, please skip. If you think General Tao chicken is really delicious, please skip. If you are not a native Chinese but aspire for good Chinese food once in a while, read on. When you walk in a Chinese restaurant, whether in the Bay Area, New York, Los Angeles or Hawaii, you might fancy ordering like a native Chinese and get something really authentic, not invented-in-America kind of Chinese food (such as General Tao chicken). The challenge is, it's very difficult to navigate through a Chinese restaurant's menu as no one really understands the English portion of it. Chinese would just go straight to the last two pages that are written entirely in Chinese (so called "Chef's Recommendations") to order. If you don't read Chinese, this option is not available to you. Well, unless you read on ...</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../order-like-native-Chinese-in-Chinese-restaurant"> more </a>

    <h2>A Dummy's Guide to Set Up Static Site with Github Page and Pelican</h2>

    <div class="summary"><p>In early March I migrated the Good, the Bad, and the Curious from the draconian Wordpress architecture to a much more elegant static site structure hosted on Github Page using a static site generator Pelican. The original conversion was quite an involving effort of a series of trial-and-error because of the respective idiosyncrasies from Github Page itself, a fast-evolving Pelican, and legacy issues from Wordpress. The second time is a charm. I managed to set up the second site within only a few hours last night. Because OC is a brand new site from scratch, I didn't have to deal with Wordpress anymore. This guide is for my own reference (in case I forget), as well as for anyone who might try to do the same - to create a new static contents site on Github Page with Python-friendly Pelican if you're more familiar with Ruby).</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../guide-to-set-up-github-page-and-pelican"> more </a>

    <div class="summary"><p>Sawyer Camp Trail follows Crystal Springs Reservoir, which is one of the major sources for drinking water of the entire San Francisco Bay Area. It's regarded as one of the best jogging and walking trails in the Bay Area. Along the pristine Crystal Springs Reservoir, there are three segments of trails, San Andreas Segment in the north, Sawyer Camp Trail in the middle, and Crystal Springs trail in the south. Sawyer Camp segment is connected to San Andreas Segment via a walking/jogging trail. Currently no direction connection between Sawyer Camp and Crystal Springs due to the bridge construction.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../sawyer-camp-trail"> more </a>

    <div class="summary"><p>Many of my friends including myself have contemplated creating new business models in the travel space over the years. This is an interesting area that resonates with many people's personal experiences and something that almost everyone can relate to. We often feel there is something missing here or there, and it's not easy to articulate exactly where and what. Travel business, unlike movie and other business, is very hard to determine what is the basic element for a single data entry point. From the perspective of a database (which is the backbone of every Internet business), if the data point cannot be universally defined and understood, then there is no database to speak of and no business to be built upon.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../info-discovery-of-travel"> more </a>
