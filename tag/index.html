	<div class="summary"><p>I have done a lot of presentations in my life, from participating in an English speech contest for high-school students broadcast live on China's national television (CCTV) at age 15, to delivering a company presentation on China's largest VC/PE firm - CDH's annual LP conference in Venetian, Macau. This "A Day In A Sloan's Life" presentation, as a "ramp" speech delivered to the Sloan Fellows of 2014 and Sloan Fellows of 2013 in CEMEX Auditorium in Stanford Graduate Business School on April 14, 2013, during Sloan's April Orientation, left everything before it in dust. It was finished right at the very last second before class president John Barton finished his introduction of me.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2013/04/a-day-in-a-sloans-life/">more…</a>

GE has given me every professional skill I have and its affiliation accounts for 62.78% of all my friends. So, it means a lot to me. What makes my eight years of GE experience such a joy ride is you, unmistakably you. Thank you for being there with me. Thank you for the good times and I hope to continue them in the future.

	<div class="summary"><p>GE’s stock has been in a 5-year slump since 2001. Immelt’s got a tough job. He’s been relentlessly doing everything humanely possible to make the same GE sales pitch to analysts, major shareholders, the board, customers, employees, Dave Calhoun and himself. Fortune’s November issue runs a cover story on him and the photo displays his now completely-turned-silver hair. I recall his hair was mostly black when I saw him in Tokyo in mid–2001. Despite the best efforts from one of the best CEOs working today, investors are through buying it. GE stock is still going nowhere.</p> <a class="btn primary xsmall" href="../posts/2006/05/break-up-GE-to-unlock-its-value/">more…</a>
