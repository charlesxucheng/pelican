    <p>My prediction of 2015 Oscar winners in eleven major categories:</p>
<p>Best Picture</p>
<h2>Birdman</h2>
<p>Every shot and scene of this movie has "Oscar" written on it. It's got such an ambitious vision and executes it so flawlessly. It strikes an overall balance of universally resonating story (a hero's journey of redemption), excellent acting all around (Keaton, Norton, Stone), perfect pace (done in one continuous shot), and creativity (mix of magical surrealism).</p>
<p>Best Director</p>
<h2>Richard Linklater</h2>
<p>Probably no director in the history of movies is as ambitious as Linklater when he undertook the journey of making Boyhood in 2002. It's an epic journey that embodies everything movie is supposed to be, back to its original root. What he's accomplished, is extremely inspiring and admirable. The story can probably connect to every American family at different levels. It would have been easy for Linklater to over-dramatize the story or over-stretch characters' conflict, like  what happened to American Sniper, but he didn't. This award is long overdue for Linklater.</p>
<p>Best Actor in a Leading Role</p>
<h2>Michael Keaton</h2>
<p>This category is the most competitive one tonight, as every nominee delivers sizzling performance. By pure acting feat, Redmayne, Keaton, Cumberbatch, Carell, Cooper can all go home with this award credibly. That said, Keaton has been a soldier in this industry and basically acts his heart out with his own life. Everybody other nominee still has their shot at Oscar but this is probably the last chance for Keaton. He deserves this.</p>
<p>Best Actress in a Leading Role</p>
<h2>Julian Moore</h2>
<p>The competition is over. Moore has swept all the leading actress awards so far leading up to Oscar. She's been doing great work consistently over the years and an Oscar nod is long overdue for her. </p>
<p>Best Actor in a Supporting Role</p>
<h2>J.K.Simmons</h2>
<p>Whiplash is basically the story of J.K.Simmons winning his Oscar. He carried the entire movie on his shoulders and mesmerize audience with every scene he's in. Unbelievable performance.</p>
<p>Best Actress in a Supporting Role</p>
<h2>Patricia Arquette</h2>
<p>There are few actresses who are willing to allow a director to capture her aging process over twelve years span. Arquette did that and gave a heartfelt performance. Her courage and commitment alone should win her this Oscar.</p>
<p>Best Original Screenplay</p>
<h2>Wes Anderson</h2>
<p>Come on, it's time to give an Oscar to Anderson. The Grand Budapest Hotel is well liked across the board but will not stand a chance with Boyhood and Birdman in the top categories. The least the Academy can do is to recognize Adnerson's writing.</p>
<p>Best Adapted Screenplay</p>
<h2>American Sniper</h2>
<p>I'm not a big fan of the movie. It's a fine movie with good direction and acting, but I'm not sure it's that good to be an Oscar Best Picture contender. American Sniper should win something at least. Maybe this is the one.</p>
<p>Best Cinematography </p>
<h2>Birdman</h2>
<p>One continuous shot for the entire movie - that's enough to trump all other contenders. </p>
<p>Best Production Design</p>
<h2>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h2>
<p>The production design is central to the overall effect of The Grand Budapest Hotel and Anderson should be recognized for his idiosyncratic cinematic vision. </p>
<p>Best Film Edit</p>
<h2>Boyhood</h2>
<p>It's impossible to even imagine the magnitude of the amount of work and the level of difficulty of editing a movie over twelve years. Boyhood will win.</p>
