    <p>In today's <a href="https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&amp;filter-coursestatus-Active=on&amp;page=0&amp;catalog=&amp;q=HISTORY+51K+-+Election+2012&amp;collapse=">Real-Life
Ethics</a>,
our lecturers/serial entrepreneurs/Sand Hill venture capitalists <a href="http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/CourseSearch/instructor?sunet=mleslie1">Mark
Leslie</a>
and <a href="http://peter.a16z.com">Peter Levine</a> gave us another intriguing
case of dilemmas involving an SEC investigation and a CFO.  A few years
ago I was just like the protagonist in that case and experienced
something similar. Surviving from the dog-eat-dog world of China's
investment/startup world, there are a few reflections I can share with
my classmates.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Part of CFO's job description says: take the blame for CEO and dodge
    the bullet for him, for the greater good of the company. CFOs of
    publicly-traded companies are all aware of this professional hazard
    when taking the job and understand this is one of the risks that
    just come with the package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It only matters when either the CEO or the CFO gets fired, because
    they sign off on the company's financial statements. In most cases,
    the firing of anybody else in the executive leadership team does not
    matter (CXO, CTO, CSO, CIO... ) to SEC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CFO who gets fired in a highly publicized SEC investigation may
    experience difficulty in finding his/her way back to a similar post
    in another public company, but that does not spell the end of
    his/her professional career and sometimes hardly even matters. It's
    very situational and depends on the PR nature of the firing. If the
    CFO is only a sacrificial lamb to save the company, people in the
    industry usually know that. There is a fairly good chance that
    his/her reputation will remain intact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For many CFOs, jobs are not found through submitting resumes to
    random employers who don't share a mutual friend with him/her. If a
    future employer still has questions about this past SEC
    investigation, don't work for him and find somebody else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CFOs are not hard to find; but great CFOs that can hold on his/her
    own against a volatile and inexperienced board are very hard to come
    by.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Situations like this where the CFO is getting fired for saving the
    company/CEO presents an excellent opportunity for the CFO to
    negotiate the best deal (golden parachute, forgiven loan, escalated
    bonus) with the company. CFO has the most information and holds all
    the cards. He can talk to SEC to thoroughly destroy the company if
    his demands are not met. He brings very creditable threat in such
    negotiation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's not a bad idea for the CFO in such situation (the company is
    being investigated by SEC and the stock price tanks) to resign. If
    he doesn't resign =&gt; the SEC investigation drags on =&gt; the stock
    price plunges =&gt; his options are all underwater =&gt; no point for
    him to stay on anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the CFO should not volunteer to resign. Because doing so gives
    up his best negotiation opportunity. He should wait for the
    CEO/board to make a proposal to him and negotiate from there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stock ownership plan is not fair to the executives. Use options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Company loans made to company executives are meant to be forgiven in
    practice. Don't make such loans. They are invitation for endless
    troubles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
