            <p>Reflected from today's S353 Entrepreneurship: Formation of New Business,
Case SHED:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>3 is the best number for the size of a startup team (even Google's
    Brin and Page had to bring Schmidt to balance out). 4 is usually not
    very stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not split equity equally. It rarely works out. In the case of 3
    founders, make sure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a single largest shareholder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The equity stake of any two founders is greater than the third
    one's</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not discuss equity split until there is a tangible idea to work
    on and everyone knows what his/her role is. Discussion on equity
    split, once occurred, is very difficult to roll back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not form a partnership only based on common interests, or purely
    based on friendship. Every condition below has to be met before
    forming a startup partnership:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>same value system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>common interest areas (entertainment, mobile Internet,
    healthcare, agriculture... something)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a business idea that all parties agree to commit to (could be a
    vague one.. but there has to be one)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>complementary skill set</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vetting on team members during GSB days is essential, but may not be
    sufficient. A man's true character and personality are only revealed
    when there is significant money at stake. TGIFs, study group
    discussions, coffee breaks at Coupa, study trips, all these
    interactions certainly help to understand someone's value system and
    integrity, but founders should not get too carried away on those
    findings. When there is no real money at play, it's not hard to get
    along with most people in GSB. GSB's environment, compared to
    real-life startup situations, is not stressful enough to put a man
    in a corner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of defensible and sustainable business model is
    over-rated (Monitor Group did go bankrupt). A startup play is to
    arbitrage on the constraint optimization. When other players in the
    market see the same potential, that arbitrage opportunity will
    diminish unless the company reinvents itself. Everything is in
    relative sense - a startup is only as successful as the founders are
    able to exit with respectable return before it's lost its edge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attending trade shows to get business ideas? This might work in the
    case of SHED, but I won't use that as the main source of idea
    generation. My problem, and my partners' problem, has always been
    that we have way too many ideas we want to work on, and we only have
    limited resources. I've never been in a situation like, oh my god, I
    have no idea what to start up with. Let me go attend a trade show to
    get some ideas. I get hit by ideas all the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do founders know an idea is new? In our case, it's very simple.
    All three of us are very well informed and plugged in our own
    networks. If an idea pops up and none of us has heard about it
    before, almost by definition it has to be a new idea (otherwise we
    would have known).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The success of SHED case brings out a very interesting business
    strategy that is pretty rare but could be highly effective.
    Occasionally, a small player can leverage existing competition and
    play off against big players. For details, read Isaac Asimov's
    Foundation series.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting a new business without domain expertise is very possible,
    as Sarah Blakely of Spanx, Tory Burch of Tory Burch, and Scott and
    Eric from SHED have demonstrated. With enough passion and
    dedication, it's not that hard to catch up on the knowledge and
    experience. It's not easy, but can be done.</p>
