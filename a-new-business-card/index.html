    <p>Usually when I procrastinate on something, I'll try to find ways to
amuse myself and keep myself motivated. As I was procrastinating on the
preparation for the upcoming Accounting and Global Strategy final exams
over the weekend, I thought it would be fun to design my own business
cards for the Seattle trip next week. The staff at Palo Alto Fedex
office on California Ave was extremely helpful and gave me all the
necessary instructions. So I came up with this design using good old
PowerPoint. It worked well. The proof sample looked pretty sleek. I
shall receive the actual cards by Monday.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/bizcard_cover.png", width="600px"></p>
<p>When I first came to Stanford GSB Sloan Program, I did not feel business
card was going to be of much use here in Stanford/the Bay area. The use
of business cards is not as prevalent as in China. Most people seem to
be content with getting a phone number/email by the end of a pleasant
conversation. It's not common to see people give out business cards
hard-selling themselves, at least not on Stanford campus.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/bizcard_back.png", width="600px"></p>
<p>Having said that, many Sloans still ordered the standard business cards
from Stanford Sloan Program, which has a nice Stanford logo.
Occasionally it's still useful, during info sessions or networking
events like Tailgate parties.</p>
<p>During our Seattle company visit trip next week, more than 60 Sloans
will be meeting with alumni and executives from various companies. The
thought of so many of us giving out almost identical business cards to
the same VIP made me wonder, maybe this is the time to get creative. I
need to figure out a way to distinguish myself from others, and I should
use my business card as the most potent vehicle for my personal branding
- a subject that has been the center of attention among me, my brother
<a href="http://www.steve-qing-yang.com/">Steve</a>, and some old and new friends.</p>
<p>So here it is. The font is primarily Helvetica. The color for the cover
is tangerine. The "cloud" on the back took some painstaking effort to
complete - it was done manually by aligning every textbox into the right
position with the right color and font size, all in PowerPoint.
PowerPoint does a ratherÂ appalling job in rendering fonts. Some fonts
looked pretty goofy when the size was below 8. Fortunately PDF saved the
day. When I saved the PPT file as a PDF (on my Macbook Air), magically
PDF rendered all the fonts in their 100% glory and accuracy. Voila!</p>
