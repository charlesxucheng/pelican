		<div><p>Even though finance is clearly a wrong career choice for me, I have after all immersed myself in corporate finance and investment (occasionally, accounting) for  nearly twenty years. For a finance guy in his past life, reading Warren Buffett's annual letter to shareholders used to be a ritual. Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway provides an intriguing contrast for another super conglomerate - General Electric. Some of their similarities were addressed in my earlier writing <a href="../../../break-up-GE-to-unlock-its-value/">"Break Up GE to Unlock Its Value" (2006)</a>. It's been my long-time dream to attend Berkshire Hathaway's world-renowned Annual Shareholders' General Meeting (AGM) in Omaha, Nebraska, to experience the legend live. Circa 2014, that dream is coming true with the courtesy of a Stanford friend.</p>
<p><em>The Prelude</em></p>
<p>Every Berkshire Hathaway ("BH") shareholder is entitled to four tickets/credentials for AGM (spouse + 2 kids presumably). This credential is the pass for AGM. For each shareholder, no matter how many BH shares he/she actually owns, he/she can only have four credentials. Given BH's share price, it's a rare privilege to get hold of such a credential.</p>
<p>AGM takes place in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/CenturyLink+Center+Omaha/@41.263831,-95.927996,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x87938fba1e4a10db:0xe896a8b5037ce4d0">Centurylink Center Omaha</a>. A huge (by Nebraska standard) sports stadium/convention center, it's right in the downtown center of Omaha.</p>
<p>There are many ways to get into Omaha. Besides flying to Omaha's airport (OMA), one can also fly into the nearby Kansas City or Iowa state and drive to Omaha during the day. It takes about 1.5 hours to drive from Kansas City and much less time to drive from Iowa. Omaha is a small city in the middle of nowhere. BH's AGM is probably the biggest event for this tiny city every year and it will surely max out the city's capacity in every way. Booking flight early would be a good idea.</p>
<p>Flying route determines accommodation plan. Omaha's local hotel leaves much to be desired. The number is limited and the price can get very pricy. I booked my flight and hotel about 5-6 weeks ago. AGM regulars usually make bookings for airfare, hotel and rental car six months in advance.</p>
<p>AGM is a three-day event that starts on Friday and ends on Sunday. For most casual visitors, only attending Saturday event until 4pm should probably be enough (basically, the entire Q&amp;A section of Buffett and Munger). Activities on Friday, Saturday night, and Sunday are more like icing on the cake. They're nice add-ons but mostly just optional. </p>
<p>As we all know, Buffett invests in a bunch of old-school traditional American businesses that are not exactly awe-inspiring at the first look. BH's AGM is a huge marketing promotion effort for all its portfolio companies. Attending BH's AGM is like going to a Chinese temple festival (庙会), buying all sorts of nice little items along the way, say your prayer to the buddha, and have a good time with friends.</p>
<p><em>Act I</em></p>
<p>We flew into Omaha on Friday afternoon. Greenfield greeted us the moment we drove out of Omaha Eppley Airfield. It was such a refreshing sight for our eyes that are used to the California golden color in early spring. The hotel was crappy as expected. With the rate at nearly $100, the room is just barely livable. </p>
<p>Omaha is famous for its steak. All the well-known restaurants like Buffett's favorite <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/gorats-steak-house-omaha">Gorat</a> and <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/piccolo-petes-omaha-2">Piccolo Pete's</a> were fully booked for the entire weekend. We went to a nearby steakhouse <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/anthonys-steakhouse-omaha-2">Anthony's Steakhouse</a>. The meat was juicy, not bad.</p>
<p>The holy grail of AGM is getting a seat as close to the stage as possible, for a clear glimpse of every facial expression of Buffett and Munger. Getting to the stadium early enough and finding a parking spot is the key. Over dinner, in the absence of more well-informed AGM regulars, we made a monumental decision to get to CenturyLink tomorrow by 730am (the event starts at 830am) instead of 7am. We figured that should give us sufficient leverage to achieve the objective. In retrospective, boy we were a little off, by like, two hours. Apparently most AGM regulars get to the stadium by 5am to get into the line, then dash to the center stage the moment the gate is open. We wish we had known better.</p>
<p>Saturday morning, we drove to CenturyLink. By the time we arrived there at about 645am, it was already difficult to find a parking spot. Luckily we found parking at the next-door Hilton Omaha with a mere daily charge of $8. </p>
<p>Rushing into the stadium, we realized all the seats at the ground and second floor were long gone. We had to speed-walk around the entire arena for half an hour to finally find a half-empty row with six consecutive seats at the upper-level deck. Whew! This is like a rock concert!</p>
